    Redefinition</h1>

      Example:</h3>
    <blockquote>
      In July 1993, the Commonwealth Fund released the results of a telephone survey of
      2,500 women, designed and carried out by Louis Harris and Associates. The Commonwealth
      and Harris investigators took their questions directly from the Gelles and Straus
      survey&#8230;. [T]he Harris/Commonwealth survey concluded that as many as four million
      women a year were victims of physical assaults&#8230;. But the most interesting
      finding of all, and one entirely overlooked by the press, for it did not harmonize
      with the notes of alarm in the Harris/Commonwealth press releases, was the response
      the poll received&#8230;about the most severe forms of violence. Gelles and Straus
      had estimated that these things happen to fewer than 1 percent of women. According
      to the survey sample, the percentage of women who had these experiences was virtually
      <em>zero</em>; all respondents answered 'no' to all the questions on severe violence.
      This finding does not, of course, mean that no one was brutally attacked. But it
      does suggest that severe violence is relatively rare.
      <p>
        So where did the four million figure for physical assault come from? &#8230; Clearly
        the interpreters of the Harris/Commonwealth poll data were operating with a much
        wider conception of 'abuse' than Gelles and Straus. Looking at the "survey instrument",
        we find that they had indeed opened the door wide to the alarmist conclusions they
        disseminated. &#8230; To arrive at the figure of four million for <em>physical</em>
        abuse, the survey used the simple expedient of ignoring the distinction between
        minor and severe violent acts, counting all acts of violence as acts of abuse. Five
        percent of women they spoke to said they had been "pushed, grabbed, shoved, or slapped";
        they were all classified as victims of domestic violence and added in to get a projection
        of four million victims nationwide. &#8230; If a couple has a fight, and she stomps
        out of the room (or yard), and he grabs her arm, this would count as a violent physical
        assault on her.

        <p>
      &#8230;As for jounalists and the newscasters, their interests too often lie in giving
      a sensational rather than an accurate picture of gender violence, and they tend
      to credit the advocacy sources. Better four million or five than one or two. &#8230;
      And all the better, too, if the media's readers and viewers get the impression that
      the inflated figures refer not to slaps, shoves, or pushes but to brutal, terrifying,
      life-threatening assaults.</blockquote>

          Exposition:</h3>
        <p>
          To redefine a term is, of course, to assign it a new meaning. It is not necessarily
          <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a> to give a term a new meaning,
          and it is often done to produce technical terms, but it is a logical <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap">
            boobytrap</a>. There is always a danger of slipping back into using the term in
          its old meaning out of habit, which could cause a fallacy of equivocation. We may
          start out reasoning with the term using its new meaning in the <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">
            premiss</a>es, then fall back into using it in its familiar meaning in the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
              conclusion</a>.
          <p>
            There are two types of redefinition, depending on whether the redefined meaning
            has a wider or narrower <a href="glossary.html#Extension">extension</a> than the
            original meaning:
            <img src="Lowredef.bmp" alt="Low Redefinition" border="0">
            <ul>
              <li><a name="LowRedef"><strong>Low Redefinition:</strong></a> A redefinition is called
                "low" when the redefined term has a wider extension than originally. For instance,
                if the word "bat" were redefined as "flying animal", then not only would bats be
                "bats", but so would many birds as well. So, the defining characteristic of a low
                redefinition is that the redefined term applies to some cases that the term in its
                original meaning does not.
                <br>
                <img src="Hiredefi.bmp" alt="High Redefinition" border="0">
                <li><a name="HiRedef"><strong>High Redefinition:</strong></a>
              A "high" redefinition is the opposite of a low one, that is, a redefinition is called
              "high" when the redefined term has a narrower extension than originally. For instance,
              if the word "bird" were redefined as "feathered flying animal", then flightless
              birds such as ostriches and penguins would no longer be "birds". So, the defining
              characteristic of a high redefinition is that the original term applies to some
              cases that the term in its redefined meaning does not.</ul>
            <p>
              High and low redefinition are not mutually exclusive categories, as it is possible
              for a redefinition to be both high and low. This happens when the redefinition applies
              to some things that the original definition did not, and fails to apply to other
              things that the original did. For example, if we redefine "bird" as "flying animal",
              then bats would be "birds" (low), while flightless birds would not (high).
              <p>
                It is even possible for the extension of a redefined term to be <a href="glossary.html#Disjoint">
                  disjoint</a> from the extension of the original meaning. This often happens when
                an existing word is redefined as a technical term. Fortunately, such technical terms
                are not likely to result in equivocation because the term's two meanings are too
                different to be confused. Confusion is most likely to occur when the slippage between
                meanings is subtle.

                  Exposure:</h3>
                <p>
                  Statistical studies of <a href="glossary.html#Vague">vague</a> concepts require
                  redefinition so that the extension of the concept can be counted, which opens up
                  the way for confusion and deception. Political groups and charities often have an
                  interest in exaggerating the prevalence of some problem so that money can be raised,
                  and political support mobilized, to address it. For this reason, polls and other
                  studies of social problems commissioned by interest groups frequently use low redefinition
                  in order to pump up the numbers. Moreover, the media often play along with interest
                  groups because alarmingly high numbers make for attention-getting stories. So, the
                  next time you hear about such a study, find out whether it was produced by a group
                  with an interest in exaggerating the numbers, and ask yourself whether the numbers
                  reported are plausible. If the numbers are implausibly high, check the report for
                  a low redefinition.

                  <p>
                    The Harris/Commonwealth poll was based on a low redefinition of "physical abuse"
                    which produced a large number of cases. "Physical abuse" is a vague concept, and
                    any statistical study of it will have to define it in some precise way in order
                    to be able to count it. Arm-grabbing and pushing may count as "physical abuse" in
                    some situations, so that it makes sense to include questions about them in the poll.
                    However, such a broad definition is a logical boobytrap which could lead to the
                    conclusion that there are more cases of severe violent assaults on women than indicated
                    by the poll.
