  <blockquote>
    [A]n adjective placed before two juxtaposed nouns is apparently the servant of either
    master. So "Fabulous Christmas Bargains" is taken to mean fabulous&#8230;bargains
    for Christmas, whereas "Continental Holiday Brochures" are brochures for continental
    holidays. It is no answer to say that commonsense will guide us to the right interpretation;
    bargains for a wonderful Christmas and continental leaflets for holidays are both
    real concepts. And what of the shop's apology based on "Temporary Assistant Shortage"?&#8213;is
    this a shortage of temporary assistants&#8230;or a temporary shortage of assistants
    (whether <em>they</em> are permanent or not)? It will be realised that this seemingly
    pithy form of expression is always technically open to two meanings, is sometimes
    actually so, and is occasionally bizarre&#8230;.</blockquote>

      Therefore, this rock is not gold.
      <h3>
        Exposition:</h3>
      <p>
        "<a href="glossary.html#Scope">Scope</a>" is a technical notion, but if you're not
        familiar with it you can acquire a grasp of it through examples. For instance, consider
        the famous saying:
        <p>
          All that glitters is not gold.
          <p>
            This <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">proposition</a> is <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguous">
              ambiguous</a> because the scope of the <a href="glossary.html#Negation">negation</a>&#151"not"&#151is
            ambiguous. There are two possible scopes, and thus two possible interpretations
            of the saying:
            <ol>
              <li><strong><a href="glossary.html#NarrowScope">Narrow scope</a>:</strong> The "not"
                negates the predicate "is gold", so that the saying is equivalent to:
                <p>
                  All that glitters is <em>non-</em>gold.
                  <p>
                    This is the most literal interpretation of the proposition, since the negation actually
                    occurs in the middle of the predicate: "is <em>not</em> gold". However, since gold
                    does glitter, this interpretation makes the saying into a false proposition.
                    <li><strong><a href="glossary.html#WideScope">Broad scope</a>:</strong> The "not"
                      negates the entire rest of the sentence, that is: "all that glitters is gold". In
                      other words, the proposition is equivalent to:
                      <p>
                        <em>Not</em> all that glitters is gold.
                        <p>
                          This, of course, is the correct interpretation, meaning that <em>some</em>
              things which glitter are non-gold, for instance, fool's gold. Or, in another clich&eacute,
              don't judge a book by its cover.</ol>
            <p>
              Logical terms such as "not" have a scope, that is, a part of the proposition in
              which they occur that they affect logically. For example, "not" logically negates
              some part of the proposition, or the proposition taken as a whole, and this is its
              scope.
              <p>
                In the artificial languages of logic, scope <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguity">ambiguity</a>
                is avoided by conventions for interpreting propositions, and by introducing additional
                punctuation (usually parentheses) to indicate scope. Contrastingly, in natural languages,
                while there are various grammatical devices to indicate scope, ambiguity is still
                frequent. Often, natural language is disambiguated by common sense knowledge that
                we bring to our interpretations. For instance, in the example, we automatically
                reject the first interpretation because that would make the proposition false. Thus,
                scope ambiguity in natural language is often not obvious until pointed out, or exploited
                for humor.
                <p>
                  Usually, scope ambiguity takes the form of a "broad" and "narrow" scope, as in the
                  example, where the broad scope often is the entire sentence, and the narrow scope
                  is some smaller part of it. Since this is a type of structural ambiguity, and not
                  equivocation on the meaning of words, scope ambiguity is a type of amphiboly.
                  <p>
                    The following types of logical and grammatical categories have scope, and are therefore
                    liable to ambiguities of scope in natural languages:
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Propositional connectives:</strong> "not", "and", "or", etc.
                        <li><strong>Quantifiers:</strong> "every", "some", etc. See <a href="quanshif.html">
                          Quantifier-Shift Fallacy</a>
                          <li><strong>Modalities:</strong> "possibly", "believes", "ought", etc. See <a href="modlscop.html">
                            Modal Scope Fallacy</a>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Example:</strong> "If Sam Clemens was Mark Twain, then he <em>must</em>
                              have written <cite>Huck Finn</cite>."
                              <p>
                                This sentence has two possible meanings depending upon the scope of "must":
                                <ol>
                                  <li><strong>Narrow scope:</strong> The scope of "must" is the <a href="glossary.html#Consequent">
                                    consequent</a> of the <a href="glossary.html#ConditionalProp">conditional</a>: Given
                                    that Sam Clemens and Mark Twain were the same person, then this person <em>had to</em>
                                    write <cite>Huck Finn</cite>, that is, he could not do otherwise. This interpretation,
                                    of course, is false.
                                    <li><strong>Wide scope:</strong> The scope of "must" is the conditional proposition
                                      as a whole: It necessarily follows from the fact that Sam Clemens was identical
                                      with Mark Twain, that he wrote <cite>Huck Finn</cite>. This is the correct interpretation;
                                      since we know that Mark Twain wrote <cite>Huck Finn</cite>, it follows with necessity
                                      from the fact that Sam Clemens <em>was</em> Mark Twain that Clemens wrote <cite>Huck
                                        Finn</cite>.</ol>
                                <li><strong>Adverbial and adjectival modifiers:</strong>
                                  <p>
                                    <strong>Example:</strong> "little girls' school"
                                    <p>
                                      This phrase has two possible meanings depending upon the scope of "little":
                                      <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Narrow scope:</strong> A school for small girls. "Little" modifies "girls'".
                                          <li><strong>Wide scope:</strong>
                                        A girls' school which is small. "Little" modifies "girls' school".</ol>
                    </ul>

                      Scope ambiguities, as ambiguities in general, are linguistic <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap">
                        boobytrap</a>s which can cause people to fall into fallacy. Of all amphibolies,
