    Form:</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Rule:</strong> <strong>X</strong>s are generally <strong>Y</strong>s.
    <br />
    <strong>x</strong> is an <strong>X</strong>.
    <br />
    <strong>x</strong> is an exception to the rule because it is <strong>I</strong>
    (where <strong>I</strong> is an irrelevant characteristic).
    <br />
    Therefore, <strong>x</strong> is not a <strong>Y</strong>.
    <h3>
      Example:</h3>
    <blockquote>
      The law requires everyone to follow the speed limit and other traffic regulations,
      but in Suffolk County, exceptions should be made for cops and their families, police
      union officials say.
      <p>
        Police Benevolent Association president Jeff Frayler said Thursday it has been union
        policy to discourage Suffolk police officers from issuing tickets to fellow officers,
        regardless of where they work.
        <p>
      "Police officers have discretion whenever they stop anyone, but they should particularly
      extend that courtesy in the case of other police officers and their families," Frayler
      said in a brief telephone interview Thursday. "It is a professional courtesy."</blockquote>

          Counter-Example:</h3>
        <p>
          Police officers occasionally have to shoot and kill suspects. So, family members
          of police officers should never be charged with murder if they shoot and kill someone.
          It's a professional courtesy.
          <h3>
            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            Many rules&#151called <a href="glossary.html#Ruleofthumb">"rules of thumb"</a>&#151have
            exceptions for relevant cases. The fallacy of Special Pleading occurs when someone
            argues that a case is an exception to a rule based upon an irrelevant characteristic
            that does not define an exception.
            <h3>
              Exposure:</h3>
            <p>
              People are most tempted to engage in special pleading when they are subject to a
              law or moral rule that they wish to evade. People often attempt to apply a "double
              standard", which makes an exception to the rule for themselves&#151or people like
              them&#151but applies it to others. They usually do not argue that they, or their
              group, should be exempt from the rule simply because of who they are; this would
              be such obvious special pleading that no one would be fooled. Instead, they invoke
              some characteristic that they have that sets them apart; however, if the characteristic
              is not a relevant exception to the rule, then they are engaged in special pleading.

                  Analysis of the Example:</h3>
              </a>
              <p>
                The rule in this example is the speed limit, which has exceptions. For instance,
                it is legally permissible for on-duty police officers, driving their official vehicles,
                to break the speed limit in pursuit of criminals or to answer emergency calls. However,
                off-duty officers driving private cars have no more reason to break the speed limit
                than do other citizens.

                The mere fact of being a police officer is an irrelevant characteristic rather than
                an exception to the law. <a href="glossary.html#Afortiori"><em>A fortiori</em></a>,
                it is an irrelevant characteristic to be a family member of a police officer. So,
                it is a case of special pleading to argue that off-duty police officers and their
                families should not be ticketed in circumstances in which a civilian would be.
