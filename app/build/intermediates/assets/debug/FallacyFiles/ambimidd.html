      A categorical syllogism is, by definition, an <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>
      with three categorical <a href="glossary.html#Term">term</a>s occurring within it.
      "Term" is to be understood in a semantic sense, so that a single word may ambiguously
      stand for two terms. This leads to the possibility of ambiguous syllogisms in which
      one of the words equivocates on two terms. Such a syllogism may commit the fallacy
      of Equivocation. Thus, Ambiguous Middle is the fallacy of Equivocation when it occurs
      within the <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a>es of a categorical syllogism.

          Jim wrote in with a criticism of the <strong>Example</strong> used above (note that
          I subsequently changed the Counter-Example by replacing "organs" with "fetuses"):
          <blockquote>
            When someone says in an argument that "All human fetuses are human," I believe it
            is clear to most people that what they mean is "All human fetuses are humans," that
            is "are human beings," but have simply made a grammatical error that has become
            acceptable through common usage. To say that the term "human" in this statement
            is ambiguous is to be purposely obtuse. That you know that the word "human" in the
            first premise is meant to be taken as a noun and not as an adjective becomes clear
            in your counter example where you chose to substitute "dog organs" for "canine organs"
            to make the counter example clearer/more intelligible. The premise "All canine organs
            are canine" sounds silly whereas the premise "All human fetuses are human" does
            not. Your "counter example" becomes:
            <blockquote>
              All dog organs are dogs.
              <br />
              Any dog must be on a leash.
              <br />
              Therefore, all dog organs must be on a leash.</blockquote>
            <p>
            and is wrong because the first premise is wrong, not because of equivocation.</blockquote>

            A couple of points in reply:
            <ul>
              <li>You seem to be under the misimpression that the argument in the <strong>Example</strong>
                is someone else's argument, but it is a <a href="glossary.html#CookedUp">cooked-up
                  example</a>, that is, it's <em>my</em> argument. However, it is based on some
                real-life arguments that I have studied, but cleaned-up and made more explicit.
                For instance, the argument used as an <strong>Example</strong> of <a href="equivoqu.html">
                  Equivocation</a> is essentially the same as the above <strong>Example</strong>.
                What I have done is to take the argument and turn it into a categorical syllogism
                in order to illustrate the syllogistic fallacy of Ambiguous Middle, which is an
                equivocation occurring in a syllogism. Unfortunately, arguments as they occur in
                the <a href="glossary.html#Raw">raw</a> often don't make good examples. I use real
                examples whenever possible, but the point of the examples and counter-examples is
                to help people understand the nature of the fallacy, and real world arguments are
                often poor examples. For this reason, the examples that I use are often too obviously
                <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>; they would never fool anyone.
                <li>Arguments which commit a fallacy of <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguity">ambiguity</a>
                  have two meanings. On one meaning, the argument is valid, but one of the premisses
                  is false or controversial. On the other meaning, the premisses are uncontroversially
                  true, but the argument is invalid. Here are the two meanings of the Example:
                  <ol>
                    <li>All human fetuses are the fetuses of human beings.
                      <br />
                      Any human being has the right to life.
                      <br />
                      Therefore, all human fetuses have the right to life.
                      <p>
                        The premisses of this argument are both uncontroversially true, but it is an invalid
                        syllogism.
                        <li>All human fetuses are human beings.
                          <br />
                          Any human being has the right to life.
                          <br />
                          Therefore, all human fetuses have the right to life.
                          <p>
                            This argument&#151which is the way in which you are interpreting the <strong>Example</strong>&#151is
                            a perfectly valid syllogism of the form <a href="glossary.html#Barbara">Barbara</a>,
                            but it has a controversial first premiss. No one who disagreed with the conclusion
                            would be likely to agree with the first premiss. For this reason, despite the fact
                            that the argument is valid, it commits a different fallacy, namely, <a href="begquest.html">
                              Begging the Question</a>
                    , that is, it has a question-begging first premiss.</ol>
                  <p>
                    The way in which ambiguous arguments are persuasive is by combining both these meanings
                    into one, so that they seem to be both valid and to have uncontroversial premisses.
                    But it is only by switching back and forth mentally between the two meanings of
                    the ambiguous term that such an argument will seem to be <a href="glossary.html#Sound">
                      sound</a>.
                    <p>
              Thanks for raising a difficult issue, Jim, and I hope that this clarifies it at
              least a little.</ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Acknowledgment:</strong> Thanks to Elijah Smith for a criticism of the Counter-Example
              that led me to revise it.
