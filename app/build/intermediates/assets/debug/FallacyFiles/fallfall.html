    Fallacy Fallacy</h1>
  <strong>Alias:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Argumentum ad Logicam</li>
    <li>Fallacist's Fallacy</li></ul>
  <strong>Type:</strong> <a href="badreasn.html">Bad Reasons Fallacy</a>
  <h3>
    Form:</h3>
  <p>
    Argument <strong>A</strong> for the conclusion <strong>C</strong> is fallacious.
    <br />
    Therefore, <strong>C</strong> is false.</p>
  <h3>
    Exposition:</h3>
  <p>
    Like anything else, the concept of <a href="logifall.html">logical fallacy</a> can
    be misunderstood and misused, and can even become a source of <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">
      fallacious</a> reasoning. To say that an <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>
    is fallacious is to claim that there is no sufficiently strong logical connection
    between the <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a>es and the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
      conclusion</a>. This says nothing about the <a href="glossary.html#TruthValue">truth-value</a>
    of the conclusion, so it is unwarranted to conclude that a <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">
      proposition</a> is false simply because some argument for it is fallacious.</p>
  <p>
    It's easy to come up with fallacious arguments for any proposition, whatever its
    truth-value. What's hard is to find a <a href="glossary.html#Cogent">cogent</a>
    argument for a proposition, even when it's true. For example, it is now believed
    by mathematicians that the proposition known as "Fermat's last theorem" is true,
    yet it took over three centuries for anyone to prove it. In the meantime, many in<a
      href="glossary.html#Valid">valid</a> arguments were presented for it.</p>
  <h3>
    Exposure:</h3>
  <p>
    It is reasonable to, at least provisionally, reject an improbable proposition for
    which <em>no</em> adequate evidence has been presented. So, if you can show that
    <em>all</em> of the common arguments for a certain proposition are fallacious, and
    the burden of proof is on the proposition's proponents, then you do not commit this
    fallacy by rejecting that proposition. Rather, the fallacy is committed when you
    jump to the conclusion that just because <em>one</em> argument for it is fallacious,
    no cogent argument for it can exist.</p>
