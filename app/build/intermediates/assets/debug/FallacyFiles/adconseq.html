    Example:</h3>
  <blockquote>
    &#133I want to list seventeen summary statements which, if true, provide abundant
    reason why the reader should reject evolution and accept special creation as his
    basic world-view. &#133
    <p>
      13. Belief in special creation has a salutary influence on mankind, since it encourages
      responsible obedience to the Creator and considerate recognition of those who were
      created by Him. &#133
      <p>
    16. Belief in evolution and animal kinship leads normally to selfishness, aggressiveness,
    and fighting between groups, as well as animalistic attitudes and behaviour by individuals.</blockquote>

      <h3>
        Exposition:</h3>
      <p>
        Arguing that a <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">proposition</a> is true because
        belief in it has good consequences, or that it is false because belief in it has
        bad consequences is often an irrelevancy. For instance, a child's belief in Santa
        Claus may have good consequences in making the child happy and well-behaved, but
        these facts have nothing to do with whether there really <em>is</em> a Santa Claus.
        <p>
          Beliefs have many consequences, both good and bad. For instance, belief that smoking
          cigarettes causes lung cancer may have such bad consequences as frightening cigarette
          smokers or making them depressed, but it may also have such good consequences as
          motivating people to stop smoking, thus lowering their risk of cancer. However,
          the most important consequences of the belief, or lack thereof, that smoking causes
          lung cancer are affected by the <em>fact</em> that it does so. In other words, we
          cannot determine the <a href="glossary.html#TruthValue">truth-value</a> of a belief
          from its consequences alone, since many of those consequences are dependent upon
          its truth-value. If smoking didn't cause disease, then the bad consequences of believing
          it does would greatly outweigh the benefits; but since it does, the situation is
          reversed.
          <p>
            Since the irrelevancy of belief to truth-value is intuitively obvious, it is often
            suppressed in fallacious Arguments to the Consequences. However, one can tell that
            the fallacy is being committed because the supposed consequences do not follow from
            the proposition itself, but only from belief in it.
            <h3>
              Exposure:</h3>
            <p>
              There are two types of <a href="glossary.html#Cogent">cogent</a> <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
                argument</a> with which this fallacy is easily confused:
              <ol>
                <li>When an argument concerns a policy or plan of action&#151instead of a proposition&#151then
                  it is reasonable to consider the consequences of acting on it.
                  <li>When an argument is about a proposition, it is reasonable to assess the <em>truth-value</em>
                    of any <em>logical</em>
                consequences of it. Logical consequences should not be confused with causal consequences,
                and truth or falsity should not be confused with goodness or badness.</ol>
              <p>
                Appeals to Consequences differ from these cogent forms of argument in the following
                ways:
                <ol>
                  <li>The argument is not about a plan or policy, but a proposition which therefore
                    has a truth-value.
                    <li>
                  The argument does not concern the truth-value of logical consequences of the proposition,
                  but the good or bad causal consequences of believing it.</ol>

                    <p>
                      Two of the seventeen reasons that Morris gives for belief in creationism are appeals
                      to consequences: <strong>13</strong> is an appeal to the supposed good consequences&#151"salutary
                      influence"&#151of believing in creationism, and <strong>16</strong> is an appeal
                      to the supposedly bad consequences of belief in evolution. One may doubt whether
                      these are really consequences of these beliefs, but even if so they are irrelevant
                      to the truth or falsity of creationism and evolution. Even if belief in creationism
                      makes people polite and well-behaved, it may be false for all that; even if belief
                      in evolution tends to make people selfish and aggressive, it may be true for all
                      that. Belief in Santa Claus may make people less selfish and aggressive, but sorry,
                      Virginia, there is no Santa Claus.
                      <h3>
                        Reader Response:</h3>
                      <blockquote>
                        I do not see how the quoted text is an example of the fallacy according to both
                        your exposition and analysis. In your exposition you state, "Arguing that a proposition
                        is true because belief in it has good consequences, or that it is false because
                        belief in it has bad consequences is often an irrelevancy." And in your analysis
                        you state, "One may doubt whether these are really consequences of these beliefs,
                        but even if so they are irrelevant to the truth or falsity of creationism and evolution."
                        So it would seem that to fall into "appeal to consequences" one must argue for the
                        truth or falsity of the proposition based on its consequences. But looking back
                        at the quote, I could not find an argument for the truth or falsity of the worldview,
                        only a statement as to why people should accept it. To accept a worldview is to
                        believe it. Moreover, Morris is arguing that "belief" in creationism has good effects
                        and "belief" in evolution has bad effects, therefore you should believe in creationism.
                        You wouldn't get the supposed good effects if you didn't believe it, at least according
                        to Morris. To put it in terms of your Santa Claus example, it would read:
                        <p>
                          Premise: Kids who believe in Santa are well behaved.
                          <br />
                          Premise: Kids who don't believe in Santa are poorly behaved.
                          <br />
                          Therefore, we should teach kids there is a Santa.
                          <p>
                            At no point did the example argue that there really is a Santa. If the premises
                            are false, then the argument cannot be sound, but the validity of the argument is
                            independent of the truth or falsity of the premises. The counter-example may break
                            down for the author's point of view, since I do not know any adults who believe
                            in Santa. A more applicable example may be:
                            <p>
                              Premise: Belief in a Deity leads to the following good results.
                              <br />
                              Premise: Rejection of a Deity leads to the following bad results.
                              <br />
                              Therefore, you should believe in a deity.
                              <p>
                        Again, it does not argue for the truth of the belief. I recognize that Morris was
                        a creationist and certainly thought the proposition to be true, I just don't see
                        the quoted text arguing for that truth at all.&#8213;Colin</blockquote>
                      <p>
                        Generally, if someone argues that you should believe something, that's equivalent
                        to arguing that it's true. Of course, there's a subtle distinction between arguing
                        that something is true and that you should believe it, and Morris could have written
                        something like: "The following reasons have no bearing on the truth or falsity of
                        creationism or evolution, but are reasons why you should believe the first and not
                        the second". However, he did not. Instead, he simply included his appeals to consequences
                        among a long list of other reasons. For instance, the reason immediately preceding
                        the first appeal to consequences is the following:
                        <blockquote>
                          12. There are more natural phenomena indicating the earth is very young than those
                          indicating it is old, and all the latter can easily be reinterpreted in terms of
                          young age.</blockquote>
                        <p>
                          This is a reason to believe in creationism as opposed to evolution, but only in
                          the sense that it is a reason to think that the former is true and the latter false.
                          Just because Morris doesn't explicitly say that he is arguing for the "truth" of
                          creationism doesn't get him off the hook, since that is what arguing for "acceptance
                          of" or "belief in" a theory ordinarily amounts to.
