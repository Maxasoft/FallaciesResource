            The only policy that effectively reduces public shootings is right-to-carry laws.
            Allowing citizens to carry concealed handguns reduces violent crime. In the 31 states
            that have passed right-to-carry laws since the mid-1980s, the number of multiple-victim
            public shootings and other violent crimes has dropped dramatically. Murders fell
            by 7.65%, rapes by 5.2%, aggravated assaults by 7%, and robberies by 3%.

            &#133[E]vidence shows that even state and local handgun control laws work. For example,
            in 1974 Massachusetts passed the Bartley-Fox Law, which requires a special license
            to carry a handgun outside the home or business. The law is supported by a mandatory
            prison sentence. Studies by Glenn Pierce and William Bowers of Northeastern University
            documented that after the law was passed handgun homicides in Massachusetts fell
            50% and the number of armed robberies dropped 35%.

            The Post Hoc Fallacy is committed whenever one reasons to a causal <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
              conclusion</a> based solely on the supposed cause preceding its "effect". Of course,
            it is a <a href="glossary.html#NecessaryCond">necessary condition</a> of causation
            that the cause precede the effect, but it is not a <a href="glossary.html#SufficientCond">
              sufficient condition</a>. Thus, post hoc evidence may suggest the hypothesis of
            a causal relationship, which then requires further testing, but it is never sufficient
            evidence on its own.
            <h3>
              Exposure:</h3>
            <p>
              Post Hoc also manifests itself as a bias towards jumping to conclusions based upon
              coincidences. Superstition and magical thinking include Post Hoc thinking; for instance,
              when a sick person is treated by a witch doctor, or a faith healer, and becomes
              better afterward, superstitious people conclude that the spell or prayer was effective.
              Since most illnesses will go away on their own eventually, <em>any</em> treatment
              will seem effective by Post Hoc thinking. This is why it is so important to test
              proposed remedies carefully, rather than jumping to conclusions based upon anecdotal
              evidence.

                  <p>
                    These two examples show how the same fallacy is often exploited by opposite sides
                    in a debate, in this case, the gun control debate. There are clear claims of causal
                    relationships in these <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>s. In the anti-gun
                    control example, it is claimed that so-called "right-to-carry" laws "effectively
                    reduce" public shootings and violent crime. This claim is supported by statistics
                    on falling crime rates since the mid-1980s in states that have passed such laws.
                    In the pro-gun control example, it is claimed that state and local gun control laws
                    "work", presumably meaning that the laws play a causal role in lowering handgun
                    crime. Again, the claim is supported by statistics on falling crime rates in one
                    state. However, the evidence in neither case is sufficient to support the causal
                    conclusion.
                    <p>
                      For instance, violent crime in general fell in the United States in the period from
                      the mid-1980s to the present, and&#151for all that we can tell from the anti-gun
                      control argument&#151it may have fallen at the same or higher rates in states that
                      did not pass "right-to-carry" laws. Since the argument does not supply us with figures
                      for the states without such laws, we cannot do the comparison.
                      <p>
                        Similarly, the pro-gun control argument does not make it clear when Massachusett's
                        drop in crime occurred, except that it was "after"&#151"post hoc"&#151the handgun
                        control law was passed. Also, comparative evidence of crime rates over the same
                        period in states that did not pass such a law is missing. The very fact that comparative
                        information is <em>not</em> supplied in each argument is suspicious, since it suggests
                        that it would have weakened the case.
                        <p>
                          Another point raised by these examples is the use of misleadingly precise numbers,
                          specifically, "7.65%" and "5.2%" in the anti-gun control example. Especially in
                          social science studies, percentage precision to the second decimal place is meaningless,
                          since it is well within the margin of error on such measurements. It is a typical
                          tactic of pseudo-scientific argumentation to use overly-precise numbers in an attempt
                          to impress and intimidate the audience. A real scientist would not use such bogus
                          numbers, which casts doubt upon the status of the source in the example. The pro-gun
                          control argument, to its credit, does not commit this fallacy. This suggests, though
                          it doesn't nail down, an appeal to misleading authority in the anti-gun control
                          one.
