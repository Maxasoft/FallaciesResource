        Example:</h3>
      <blockquote>
        The <cite>Literary Digest</cite>, which began its famous straw poll with the 1916
        presidential campaign, mailed out millions of mock ballots for each of its surveys.
        &#133
        <p>
          The results that poured in during the months leading up to the [1936 presidential]
          election showed a landslide victory for Republican Alf Landon. In its final tabulation,
          the <cite>Digest</cite> reported that out of the more than two million ballots it
          had received, the incumbent, Roosevelt, had polled only about 40 percent of the
          straw votes. &#133
          <p>
            Within a week it was apparent that both their results and their methods were erroneous.
            Roosevelt was re-elected by an even greater margin than in 1932. &#133 The <cite>Digest</cite>'s
            experience conclusively proved that no matter how massive the sample, it will produce
            unreliable results if the methodology is flawed.
            <p>
              &#133 The mailing lists the editors used were from directories of automobile owners
              and telephone subscribers&#133[which] were clearly weighted in favor of the Republicans
              in 1936. People posperous enough to own cars have always tended to be somewhat more
              Republican than those who do not, and this was particularly true in [the] heart
              of the Depression.
              <p>
        &#133The sample was massive, but it was biased toward the affluent, and in 1936
        many Americans voted along economic lines.</blockquote>

          Exposition:</h3>
        <p>
          This is a fallacy affecting statistical inferences, which are <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
            argument</a>s of the following form:
          <p>
            <strong>N%</strong> of sample <strong>S</strong> has characteristic <strong>C</strong>.
            <br />
            (Where sample <strong>S</strong> is a subset of set <strong>P</strong>, the population.)
            <br />
            Therefore, <strong>N%</strong> of population <strong>P</strong> has characteristic
            <strong>C</strong>.
            <p>
              For example, suppose that an opaque bag is full of marbles, and you can win a prize
              by guessing the proportions of colors of the marbles in the bag. Assume, further,
              that you are allowed to stick your hand into the bag and withdraw one fistful of
              marbles before making your guess. Suppose that you pull out ten marbles, six of
              which are black and four of which are white. The set of all marbles in the bag is
              the population which you are going to guess about, and the ten marbles that you
              removed is the sample. You want to use the information in your sample to guess as
              closely as possible the proportion of colors in the bag. You might draw the following
              <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">conclusion</a>s:
              <ul>
                <li>60% of the marbles in the bag are black.
                  <li>
                40% of the marbles in the bag are white.</ul>
              <p>
                Notice that if 100% of the sampled marbles were black, say, then you could infer
                that <em>all</em> the marbles in the bag are black, and that <em>none</em> of them
                are white. Thus, the type of inference usually referred to as "induction by enumeration"
                is a type of statistical inference, even though it doesn't use percentages. Similarly,
                from the example we could just draw the vague conclusion that <em>most</em> of the
                marbles are black and <em>few</em> of them are white.
                <p>
                  The strength of a statistical inference is determined by the degree to which the
                  sample is <em>representative</em> of the population, that is, how similar in the
                  relevant respects the sample and population are. For example, if we know in advance
                  that <em>all</em> of the marbles in the bag are the same color, then we can conclude
                  that the sample is perfectly representative of the color of the population&#151though
                  it might not represent other aspects, such as size. When a sample perfectly represents
                  a population, statistical inferences are actually <a href="glossary.html#Deductive">
                    deductive</a> <a href="glossary.html#Enthymeme">enthymeme</a>s. Otherwise, they
                  are <a href="glossary.html#Inductive">inductive</a> inferences.
                  <p>
                    Moreover, since the strength of statistical inferences depend upon the <em>similarity</em>
                    of the sample and population, they are really a species of <a href="glossary.html#ArgumentByAnalogy">
                      argument from analogy</a>, and the strength of the inference varies directly with
                    the strength of the analogy. Thus, a statistical inference will commit the Fallacy
                    of Unrepresentative Sample when the similarity between the sample and population
                    is too weak to support the conclusion. There are two main ways that a sample can
                    fail to sufficiently represent the population:
                    <ol>
                      <li>The sample is simply too small to represent the population, in which case the
                        argument will commit the <a href="glossary.html#Subfallacy">subfallacy</a> of <a
                          href="hastygen.html">Hasty Generalization</a>.
                        <li>
                      The sample is biased in some way as a result of not having been chosen randomly
                      from the population. The Example is a famous case of such bias in a sample. It also
                      illustrates that even a very large sample can be biased; the important thing is
                      representativeness, not size. Small samples can be representative, and even a sample
                      of one is sufficient in some cases.</ol>
