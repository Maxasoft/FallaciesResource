    <blockquote>
      Formal logic fails us because of its assumptions. The postulates from which the
      mechanism springs are normally abstractions of a high order, words rather than things.
      The finest of automobiles will not run on a road of air; it must have solid ground
      under the wheels. The Greeks, with their assumption that words were real things,
      naturally enough soared into rarefied regions. Human thinking has been short of
      oxygen ever since. &#8230; "Logos" is Greek for "word"; "logic" is the manipulation
      of words.</blockquote>

          Exposition:</h3>
        <p>
          The etymology of a word is an account of its historical derivation from older words
          often from a different language. An older, usually archaic, word from which a current
          word is historically derived is called its "etymon". The term "etymological fallacy"
          is applied to two types of error:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Semantic:</strong> The etymological fallacy as a semantic error is the
              mistake of confusing the current meaning of a word with the meaning of one of its
              etymons, or of considering the meaning of the etymon to be the "real" or "true"
              meaning of the current word. If one's goal is to communicate, then the "real" or
              "true" meaning of a word is its current meaning. Since the meanings of words change
              over time, often considerably, the meaning of an etymon may be very different from
              the current meaning of the word derived from it. The fact that a word historically
              derives from an etymon may be interesting, but it cannot tell us the current meaning
              of the word.
              <li><strong>Logical:</strong>The etymological fallacy as a logical mistake results
            when one reasons about the etymon as if the conclusion applied to the current word.
            This is a logical error similar to equivocation, which involves confusing two meanings
            of the same word; but it differs from equivocation in that the etymological fallacy
            involves the meanings of two different words, though those words are historically
            connected.</ol>

              <p>
                In the chapter from which this passage comes, Chase is arguing that formal logic
                is of little or no value because it involves manipulating words unconnected with
                reality. The passage commits a fallacy and sets up a logical <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap">
                  boobytrap</a>:
                <ol>
                  <li>The Greek word "logos" is actually highly <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguous" title="Having more than one meaning.">
                    ambiguous</a>, having the following meanings in addition to "word": speech, argument,
                    explanation, principle, reason, among others. But Chase mentions only one of these
                    meanings, namely, the one which supports his <a href="glossary.html#Argument" title="A unit of reasoning.">
                      argument</a>, rather than others which undermine it&#8213;such as "argument" and
                    "reason", which have an obvious bearing on the meaning of the English word "logic".
                    However, assuming that "logos" really only meant "word", would that support his
                    claim that formal logic is simply the manipulation of words? The suffix "-logy"
                    which occurs in such English words as "biology", "psychology", and even "etymology",
                    has the same source as "logic". Does this mean that every science ending in that
                    suffix is really just words about its subject matter, unconnected to reality? Of
                    course not. Just as "biology" came to mean the science of life, so "logic" has come
                    to mean the scientific study of reasoning. Thus, Chase has <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious"
                      title="Committing a logical fallacy.">fallacious</a>ly appealed to etymology to
                    support his <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion" title="The part of an argument for which evidence is given.">
                      conclusion</a>.
                    <li>
                  Chase's analogy comparing formal logic to an automobile is very weak; hadn't he
                  ever heard of airplanes? An alternative analogy would compare formal logic to a
                  plane which can travel much faster than a car by lifting off of the ground and soaring
                  into the atmosphere of abstraction. Of course, there may still be a danger of flying
                  so high that the air becomes too thin, but what is Chase's evidence that this has
                  happened to formal logic? Perhaps the analogy as Chase gives it should be taken
                  only as a colorful illustration of his point, rather than as a reason in its favor,
                  so that it doesn't constitute a fallacious analogy. However, it is at least a boobytrap
                  that might trip up a naive or unimaginative reasoner.</ol>
