    <h3>
      History:</h3>
    <p>
      As with many named fallacies, Accent has a long and confusing history. It is one
      of the thirteen fallacies identified by Aristotle in his pioneering work, <cite>On
        Sophistical Refutations</cite>. Specifically, it is one of the six language-dependent
      fallacies, of which Aristotle says "this is the number of ways in which we might
      fail to mean the same thing by the same names or expressions." Thus, according to
      Aristotle, Accent is a kind of fallacy of <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguity">ambiguity</a>.
      <p>
        To understand what Aristotle meant by "accent", one must know some things about
        the written Greek of his time. Today, in most printed Greek texts&#151including
        those of <a href="glossary.html#ThePhilosopher">"the philosopher"</a>&#151three
        accents are used to indicate pronunciation. In Aristotle's time, the accents were
        not a part of the written language, but were supplied by the reader's knowledge
        of spoken Greek, which is something that we lack today. For this reason, some words
        that were pronounced differently were spelled the same in classical Greek, that
        is, they were homographs ("written the same") but not homophones ("sound the same").
        So, a written word could be <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguous">ambiguous</a> in a
        way that depended on how it was accented in speech.
        <p>
          It is clear, from what he wrote, that Aristotle was being thorough in including
          Accent in his catalog of types of ambiguity. It is less clear just how common ambiguity
          of this type was in his day, or how often it led to <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">
            fallacious</a> reasoning.
          <h3>
            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            Putting aside historical issues, what about accent as a source of fallacy today?
            Is it possible to have ambiguity of accent in English, or other living languages?
            There are English homographs which are not homophones, "sewer", for instance. However,
            the different meanings of "sewer" are not accented differently; rather, the difference
            in pronunciation is due to the vowel sound in the first syllable. One example of
            an ambiguity of accent that I have been able to find in English are the two meanings
            of "resent"; though there is a difference in accent, there is also a difference
            in the pronunciation of the "s", so it is not a pure case of ambiguity of accent.
            <p>
              Consider the following sentence:
              <p>
                I resent that letter.
                <p>
                  This sentence could mean either that one sent the letter again, or that one has
                  a feeling of resentment towards it. So, the sentence could be a <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap">
                    boobytrap</a>. If you concluded, falsely, on the basis of the sentence, that the
                  speaker sent the letter again, then you would have committed a fallacy of accent.
                  <p>
                    Morris Engel cites the similar ambiguity of "in<a href="glossary.html#Valid">valid</a>",
                    meaning "a chronically ill person", or "not truth-preserving". However, it's difficult
                    to imagine a situation in which these different meanings would be confused. Here
                    are some examples of other words in English which have different meanings when accented
                    differently:

                    <p>
                      There seems to be a pattern of two-syllable noun/verb pairs in which the noun is
                      accented on the first syllable and the verb is accented on the second. However,
                      because the different accents mean different parts of speech, it is unlikely that
                      the distinct meanings will be confused.
                      <h3>
                        Exposure:</h3>
                      <p>
                        Ambiguities of accent occur rarely in English, so that boobytraps based on such
                        accentual ambiguities will be even rarer, and outright fallacies of Accent rarest
                        of all. In fact, I have found no uncontrived examples of Accent. Therefore, if fallacies
                        are defined as "common or tempting forms of incorrect reasoning", then there is
                        no "fallacy of Accent"&#151at least, in the English language. At any rate, I recommend
                        that textbooks stop devoting space to Accent, since it is not a useful fallacy.
                        Presumably, the main reason why it still sometimes appears is historical inertia.
                        <p>
                          Some writers on fallacies&#151e.g., Morris Engel in <cite>With Good Reason</cite>&#151discuss
                          the fallacy of <a href="quotcont.html">Quoting Out of Context</a> under the name
                          "Accent", on the grounds that a quote taken out of context changes the emphasis
                          in a misleading way. However, this is stretching Aristotle's meaning of "accent",
                          which referred specifically to accents on syllables, and not on whole passages.
                          Moreover, the kind of ambiguity that quotation out of context can lead to is seldom
                          accurately described as a shift of emphasis; rather, what the loss of context does
                          is allow the natural ambiguity of words to assert itself. For this reason, I treat
                          Quoting Out of Context as a separate, and genuine fallacy, for it is very common,
                          in contrast to Accent.

                                In a former career I worked at what was then Connecticut General Life Insurance
                                Company, and learned a little about the company's founding. It was, apparently,
                                a time between the end of the Civil war and the rise of effective state insurance
                                regulation, when insurers made most of their money by putting legions of pettifogging
                                lawyers on every claim to find a reason the policy should be canceled instead of
                                paid. So it was even worse than it sounds today that the company went by its original
                                name. As noted in the company history:
                                <blockquote>
                                  Connecticut General dates back to 1865, when Guy R. Phelps, one of the founders
                                  of Connecticut Mutual Company, saw a need for "substandard" insurance, or life insurance
                                  for poor risks. Originally the new firm was to be called Connecticut Invalid, but
                                  because of concern that the word "invalid" could be read in two ways, it became
                                  Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and began to insure healthy lives along
                                  with substandard risks.</blockquote>

                                <li>Mike Jones writes from Jinan, China:
                                  <blockquote>
                                    The best example that I know of of accent ambiguity in English is the word "outright",
                                    which, unlike words like "record" and "refuse", does not have any change in vowel-sound
                                    between the two cases. As an adjective, "outright" is accented on the first syllable,
                                    and as an adverb, on the last. It also affords a natural (i.e., non-contrived) example
                                    of a fallacy of accent:
                                    <p>
                                      He said outright, "lies!"
                                      <p>
                                    At least in spoken form, without the aid of punctuation, it is ambiguous.</blockquote>
                                  <p>
                                    Thanks for the example, Mike! A couple of points in reply:
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>The <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipd/A0571401.html"><cite>Infoplease</cite>
                                        dictionary</a> confirms that "outright" may be accented differently as an adjective
                                        or adverb, but it gives the adverbial accentuation as equal on both syllables, which
                                        conforms with my own pronunciation. Perhaps there are regional differences in the
                                        way that it's accented.

                                      In my sense of the word, your example is still "contrived", that is, it is a made-up
                                      example as opposed to one gathered from some published source. However, it's better
                                      than my original "resent" example, though I still don't think that anyone is very
                                      likely to commit a fallacy due to accentual ambiguity.</ul>
