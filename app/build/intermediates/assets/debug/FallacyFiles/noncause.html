    Non Causa Pro Causa</h1>

        Exposition:</h3>
      <p>
        This is the most general fallacy of reasoning to <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
          conclusion</a>s about causality. Some authors describe it as inferring that something
        is the cause of something else when it isn't, an interpretation encouraged by the
        fallacy's names. However, inferring a false causal relation is often just a mistake,
        and it can be the result of reasoning which is as <a href="glossary.html#Cogent">cogent</a>
        as can be, since all reasoning to causal conclusions is ultimately <a href="glossary.html#Inductive">
          inductive</a>. Instead, to be <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>,
        a causal <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a> must violate the canons of
        good reasoning about causation in some common or deceptive way. Thus, to understand
        causal fallacies, we must understand how causal reasoning works, and the ways in
        which it can go awry.
        <p>
          Causal conclusions can take one of two forms:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Event-Level:</strong> Sometimes we wish to know the cause of a particular
              event, for instance, a physician conducting a medical examination is inquiring into
              the cause of a particular patient's illness. Specific events are caused by other
              specific events, so the conclusion we aim at in this kind of causal reasoning has
              the form:
              <p>
                Event <strong>C</strong> caused event <strong>E</strong>.
                <p>
                  Mistakes about event-level causation are the result of confusing coincidence with
                  causation. Event <strong>C</strong> may occur at the same time as event <strong>E</strong>,
                  or just before it, without being the cause of <strong>E</strong>. It may simply
                  be happenstance that these two events occurred at about the same time. In order
                  to find the correct event that caused an effect, we must reason from a causal law,
                  which introduces the next level of causal reasoning:
                  <li><strong>Type-Level:</strong> A causal law has the form:
                    <p>
                      Events of type <strong>C</strong> cause events of type <strong>E</strong>.
                      <p>
                        Here, we are not talking about a causal relation holding between two particular
                        events, but the general causal relation holding between instances of two <em>types</em>
                        of event. For example, when we say that smoking cigarettes causes lung cancer, we
                        are not talking about an individual act of smoking causing a particular case of
                        lung cancer. Rather, we mean that smoking is a type of event which causes another
                        type of event, namely, cancer.
                        <p>
            Mistakes about type-level causation are the result of confusing correlation with
            causation. Two types of event may occur simultaneously, or one type always following
            the other type, without there being a causal relation between them. One common source
            of non-causal correlations between two event-types is when both are effects of a
            third type of event. For examples of causal fallacies, see the Subfallacies of Non
            Causa Pro Causa:</ol>
