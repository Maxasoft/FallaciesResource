          &#133[C]onsider the&#133argument that what is natural is somehow good and what is
          unnatural bad. &#133[T]he principle is rarely stated so explicitly, but if we look
          at what people actually do, this does seem to be an assumption that underlies people's
          behaviour. Consider, for example, the popularity of "natural" remedies. A great
          many people would always prefer to take a "natural" remedy over an "artificial"
          one. Similarly, people prefer foods that have "all natural" ingredients.
          <p>
            One obvious point to make here is that this very characterization of certain things
            as "natural" is problematic. What always strikes me about health food shops are
            the rows and rows of bottles and tablets. A greengrocer seems to be a much better
            source of natural products than such collections of distilled essences and the like.

          However, let us set aside such doubts about the category of "the natural" for the
          moment and just ask, even if we can agree that some things are natural and some
          are not, what follows from this? The answer is: nothing. There is no factual reason
          to suppose that what is natural is good (or at least better) and what is unnatural
          is bad (or at least worse).</blockquote>

            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            What is logically wrong with appealing to nature? One problem is that the concept
            of the natural is <a href="glossary.html#Vague" title="A characteristic of a concept that has borderline cases to which it is unclear whether it applies.">
              vague</a>. For instance, is the human use of fire "natural"? Maybe, maybe not.
            Is it "natural" for people to wear clothes? Yes and no. The vagueness of the notion
            of naturalness does not mean that it is useless, since there are many clearcut cases
            of the natural and the unnatural. However, it will be unclear whether an appeal
            to nature that is based on a borderline case is <a href="glossary.html#Sound" title="Valid and with true premisses.">
              sound</a>, because it will be unclear whether one of its <a href="glossary.html#Premiss"
                title="A proposition presented as evidence.">premiss</a>es is true or false.
            <p>
              Another problem is that the word "natural" is loaded with a positive evaluation,
              much like the word "normal". So, to call something "natural" is not simply to describe
              it, but to praise it. This explains why it sometimes sounds odd to call some things
              "natural" or "unnatural". For instance, it is unnatural to wear shoes, but few would
              wish to condemn the practice. For this reason, to call something "natural" and then
              to conclude that it is, therefore, good may beg the question.
              <p>
                Nonetheless, one may still feel that there is <em>some</em>thing right about some
                appeals to nature. For instance, a diet rich in natural foods&#8213;such as fruits,
                vegetables, and whole grains&#8213;is probably better than one based on more artificial
                foods&#8213;such as candy, pastries, and sausages. Also, it seems likely that a
                natural lifestyle&#8213;that is, one based on a natural diet and exercise&#8213;is
                in general a healthier one than a sedentary life spent watching television and eating
                doughnuts.
                <p>
                  These forms of argument could be treated as <a href="glossary.html#Ruleofthumb" title="A rule that holds true for all normal members of a class, but admits exceptions.">
                    rules of thumb</a> which admit some exceptions, but are still reliable enough
                  to be useful. On this view, the fact that something is either natural or unnatural
                  would give it only the presumption of goodness or badness, and that presumption
                  can be rebutted by <a href="glossary.html#ContraryProps" title="Two propositions are contrary when both cannot be true.">
                    contrary</a> evidence. To ignore or dismiss such evidence would be to commit a
                  fallacy of sweeping generalization, that is, to treat the rule of thumb as if it
                  were an exceptionless generalization. So, at best, the appeal to nature is a useful
                  rule of thumb in some limited areas, such as diet and lifestyle.

                    I have included the term "naturalistic fallacy" as an alias for this fallacy, though
                    it is misleading. The term "naturalistic fallacy" was coined by the philosopher
                    G. E. Moore, in his book <cite>Principia Ethica</cite>, to describe an alleged mistake
                    in ethics: defining "good" in naturalistic terms. So, if one were to define "good"
                    as "natural", that would be an instance of the naturalistic fallacy, according to
                    Moore. However, the naturalistic fallacy is a much broader error: for instance,
                    the utilitarian definition of "good" as "the greatest happiness of the greatest
                    number" would also commit the fallacy, since all of the terms in the definition
                    are naturalistic. Thus, there are three reasons why the appeal to nature is not
                    the same thing as the naturalistic fallacy:
                    <ol>
                      <li>The naturalistic fallacy is an alleged error in definition, not an error in argument.
                        <li>The naturalistic fallacy is an alleged error in ethics, not in logic.
                          <li>
                      Defining "good" as what is natural is, at most, an instance of the naturalistic
                      fallacy.</ol>

                          American Spirit uses the slogan "it's only natural" and claims that its cigarettes
                          are "100% natural tobacco". Some smokers may buy American Spirit cigarettes because
                          they believe that "natural" tobacco is in some way safer or healthier than tobacco
                          that contains additives. However, the carcinogens in cigarettes that cause cancer
                          are natural components of tobacco.

                              things which are extremely harmful, for example, flesh-eating bacteria."&#8213;Darren

                                I intended the Example to make that point, since tobacco is natural and the carcinogens
                                that cause lung cancer are a natural part of tobacco rather than some artificial
                                additive, as American Spirit would like you to believe. However, if the Example
                                didn't make that point clearly enough, your email should help clarify it. Thanks!
                                <li>"I was wondering, is the appeal to nature fallacy not also often an example of
                                  ignoratio elenchi, as whether something is natural or not is irrelevant to whether
                                  something is ethical or not?"&#8213;Ashley Stewart
                                  <p>
                                    I can see why you'd think that, but I hesitate to classify it that way because some
                                    ethical theories may make what is natural relevant to what is good. Of course, any
                                    simple equation of the natural with the good is easily refuted by <a href="glossary.html#CounterExample"
                                      title="An example that shows a definition to be wrong.">counter-example</a>s such
                                    as flesh-eating bacteria, tobacco, hemlock, etc. However, a more complicated definition
                                    might be immune to such refutation. More importantly, this is not really a logical
                                    problem, but a philosophical one. The logical problems with appealing to nature
                                    are the result of the <a href="glossary.html#Vagueness" title="Imprecision.">vagueness</a>
                                    and loadedness of the concept of the natural. I suspect that most people who appeal
                                    to nature are confused by the vagueness or loadedness of the term "natural", and
                                    will realize their mistake when counter-examples are pointed out to them. But if
                                    someone still insisted on appealing to nature in the face of counter-examples, I
                                    would think that they were making a philosophical mistake rather than a logical
                                    one.
                                    <li>"Although I concur that appealing to nature is indeed a fallacy I think that your
                                      example is ill-chosen. American Spirit's only claim is that their product is 100%
                                      natural. (They might be able to back that or not.) However in your analysis you
                                      are (successfully) attacking the claim that such cigarettes are more safe. Perhaps
                                      that is the 'subliminal message' that American Spirit wants to get across. But they
                                      are not stating it. In fact in the ad they are stating the opposite (forced by law,
                                      I guess). So: I think your example is weak in the sense that it attacks a claim
                                      that is only made by yourself. More precisely: The statement 'Some smokers may buy
                                      American Spirit cigarettes because they believe that "natural" tobacco is in some
                                      way safer or healthier than tobacco that contains additives' is introduced by you
                                      and it is not at all shown that this statement is implied by the ad."&#8213;Mischa

                                        First of all, it's important to keep in mind that the example is an advertisement.
                                        Ads, especially modern ones, seldom present explicit <a href="glossary.html#Argument"
                                          title="A unit of reasoning consisting of propositions.">argument</a>s with <a href="glossary.html#ArgIndicator"
                                            title="A word that indicates the occurrence of an argument.">argument indicator</a>
                                        words, such as "hence" and "therefore". However, the purpose of an ad is to sell
                                        a product, in this case cigarettes. So, to the extent that an ad contains <a href="glossary.html#Proposition"
                                          title="A sentence that is either true or false.">proposition</a>s, those propositions
                                        give the reader some reason to buy the product advertised, that is, they are premisses
                                        in an argument. In the Example, the propositions in the ad simply claim that the
                                        cigarettes are "natural". This is why the ad is an appeal to nature.
                                        <p>
                                          Secondly, it's important to realize that not all fallacies are committed by the
                                          arguer, rather it is sometimes the audience that commits the fallacy. This is why
                                          I suggested that some smokers may infer that the cigarettes are safer because they
                                          are "natural", even though the ad itself doesn't make such a claim. In that case,
                                          it's the smokers who are committing the fallacy, rather than the advertiser. The
                                          worst that the cigarette company can be charged with is setting up a <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap"
                                            title="A logical snare that is not itself fallacious, but which may cause someone to inadvertently commit a fallacy.">
                                            boobytrap</a> that ensnares some unwary smokers.

                                            The fact that some people are likely to draw such a <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious"
                                              title="Committing a fallacy.">fallacious</a> inference is supported by the explicit
                                            warning in the ad that you allude to. Like you, I don't know whether this warning
                                            was mandated by the government&#8213;as is the Surgeon General's warning&#8213;or
                                            it was simply added to avoid lawsuits. However, it is clearly designed to look like
                                            the Surgeon General's warning. As such, some smokers may either ignore it, or dismiss
                                            it as government propaganda. However, the fact that the warning is issued at all
                                            indicates that there is a known danger of some people inferring that the cigarettes
                                            are safer.

                            Given the popularity of "natural" foods and remedies, it should be obvious that
                            any time the word "natural" is attached to something that enters your body, it's
                            likely that some people will infer that it is healthy. It's clear that the advertisers
                            are aware of this danger, and should know that they are setting a boobytrap. Moreover,
                            any smoker who falls into the trap commits the fallacy. For these reasons, the ad
                            is an excellent example of an appeal to nature.</ul>
