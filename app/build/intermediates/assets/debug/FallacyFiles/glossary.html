    entries in <a href="ffweblog.html">the weblog</a>. The first occurrence of a defined
    term in a file or weblog entry is linked directly to its definition below. Since
    most of the terms are linked from multiple files, you will need to use the "Back"

  <a name="AdHocHyp"><em>Ad hoc</em> hypothesis</a>
  <blockquote>
    An auxilliary hypothesis that lacks independent support which is adopted to save
    a theory from refutation. Such hypotheses are bad because any theory can be rescued
    from refutation in this way. Auxilliary hypotheses should be justified by independent
    evidence.
    <p>
      <strong>Translation:</strong> "<em>Ad hoc</em>" means "to this", indicating that
      something is for a specific, limited purpose. For instance, an <em>ad hoc</em> committee
      is a temporary one set up to deal with a specific problem.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> Before Kepler, astronomers believed that planets moved
      in circular orbits. However, observations of planetary positions did not fit with
      this theory. The theory was saved from refutation by adopting the <em>ad hoc</em>
      hypothesis of epicycles. Of course, the theory should have been rejected because
      planets do not move in circular orbits.</p>

  <a name="Afortiori"><em>A fortiori</em></a>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>Translation:</strong> "Even more so; by a stronger reason" (<em>Latin</em>).
    <p>
      This phrase is used when arguing that what is true of a given case because it possesses
      a certain attribute will certainly be true of another case which has more of the
      relevant attribute.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> Suppose that Tommy is Timmy's older brother. We can argue
      that if Tommy is too young to see a certain movie, then <em>a fortiori</em> Timmy
      is too young, as well, since he is younger than Tommy.</p>

  <a name="Barbara"><em>Barbara</em></a>

  <blockquote>
    A linguistic snare which is not itself fallacious, but may cause someone to inadvertently
    commit a fallacy. For instance, an ambiguous or vague sentence is not in and of

    a false conclusion.</blockquote>
  <a name="BorderlineCase"><em>Borderline case</em></a>
  <blockquote>
    A case in which it is unclear whether a vague terms applies or not.

  <a name="Distributed"><em>Distributed</em></a>
  <blockquote>
    A term in a categorical proposition is distributed if and only if the proposition

    term.
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> The subject term "mammals" in "all mammals are animals"
      is distributed because the proposition implies "all cats are animals", "all dogs
      are animals", "all humans are animals", etc. In contrast, the predicate term "animals"
      is not distributed because the proposition doesn't imply that all mammals are cats.</p>

    <p>
      Usually context, namely, whether the subject is an argument or argument form, makes
      it clear which of these meanings is intended. However, sometimes this ambiguity
      is a <em>boobytrap</em> which leads to confusion. For this reason, in the Fallacy
      Files, I use "valid" only in sense 1, and "validating" for sense 2.
