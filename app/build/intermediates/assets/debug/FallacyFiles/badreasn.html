    Bad Reasons Fallacy</h1>
  <strong>Type:</strong> <a href="formfall.html">Formal Fallacy</a>
  <h3>
    Form:</h3>
  <p>
    Argument <strong>A</strong> for the conclusion <strong>C</strong> is unsound.
    <br />
    Therefore, <strong>C</strong> is false.
    <h3>
      Exposition:</h3>
    <p>
      This fallacy consists in arguing that a <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">conclusion</a>
      is false because an <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a> given for it is
      bad. It is most likely to occur in the course of a debate, when one side argues
      badly for the truth of a <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">proposition</a>, and
      the other side uses the bad argument as a reason to conclude that the proposition
      is false. It is always tempting, in the heat of debate, to think that one has established
      one's own case when all that one has succeeded in doing is undermining the opposition's
      case. To commit the Bad Reasons Fallacy is to act as though argumentation is a zero-sum
      game in which, if the other side loses, then you win.
      <h3>
        Exposure:</h3>
      <p>
        Since there are two ways that an argument can be un<a href="glossary.html#Sound">sound</a>,
        there are two versions of this fallacy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Argument <strong>A</strong> has a false <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a>.
          If an argument has a false premiss, then even if it is <a href="glossary.html#Valid">
            valid</a>, it fails to prove its <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">conclusion</a>.
          However, this does not show that the conclusion is false, as it is possible to give
          false premisses for a true conclusion.
          <li>Argument <strong>A</strong>
        is invalid. If an argument is invalid, then even if its premisses are true, it fails
        to prove its conclusion. However, this does not show that the conclusion is false,
        for it is possible to argue invalidly for a true conclusion.</ul>
      <p>
        It is tempting to think that the relation between the unsoundness of an argument
        and the falsity of its conclusion parallels the relation between the soundness of
        an argument and the truth of its conclusion. The conclusion of a sound argument
        is always true; however, the conclusion of an unsound argument may have either <a
          href="glossary.html#TruthValue">truth-value</a>. Misunderstanding this asymmetry
        is one psychological source of this fallacy.
        <p>
          In some cases, such as legal trials, where there is a presumption and a corresponding
          burden of proof, it is legitimate to reason that a proposition is false if <em>all</em>
          of the reasons given for it are bad. For instance, in a criminal trial in which
          there is a presumption of innocence, the jury should conclude that the defendant
          is innocent if <em>all</em> of the prosecution's arguments for guilt are unsound.
          However, it would still be <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a> to
          conclude that the proposition is false just because <em>one</em> argument for it
          is unsound, unless it is the <em>only</em> argument.
