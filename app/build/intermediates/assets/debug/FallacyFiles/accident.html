        <strong>X</strong>s are normally <strong>Y</strong>s.
        <br />
        <strong>A</strong> is an <strong>X</strong>. (Where <strong>A</strong> is abnormal.)
        <br />
        Therefore, <strong>A</strong> is a <strong>Y</strong>.
        <h3>
          Example:</h3>
        <p>
          Birds normally can fly.
          <br />
          Tweety the Penguin is a bird.
          <br />
          Therefore, Tweety can fly.

            Exposition:</h3>

            The fallacy of Accident, one of Aristotle's thirteen fallacies, has been interpreted
            in various ways by subsequent logicians, perhaps because of the obscurity of <a href="glossary.html#Thephilosopher">
              The Philosopher</a>'s account. I will discuss only one of these interpretations
            here, due to its relation to recent developments in logic.
            <p>
              Consider the generalization "birds can fly" from the example. Now, it isn't true
              that <em>all</em> birds can fly, since there are flightless birds. "Some birds can
              fly" and "many birds can fly" are too weak. "Most birds can fly" is closer to what
              we mean, but in this case "birds can fly" is a "<a href="glossary.html#Ruleofthumb">rule
                of thumb</a>", and the fallacy of Accident is a fallacy involving reasoning with
              rules of thumb.
              <p>
                Common sense is full of rules of thumb which do not hold universally, but which
                hold "generally" or "as a general rule", as is sometimes said. Logicians have tended
                to ignore rules of thumb, probably because of their unscientific vagueness. However,
                in the past couple of decades, primarily due to research in artificial intelligence,
                which has shown the importance of such general rules for practical reasoning, there
                has been growing interest in so-called "<a href="glossary.html#Default">default</a>"
                or "<a href="glossary.html#Defeasible">defeasible</a>" reasoning, of which rules
                of thumb are a part. As a consequence, there has also been a rebirth of interest
                in the fallacy of Accident.
                <p>
                  The difference between rules of thumb and <a href="glossary.html#UniversalGen">universal
                    generalization</a>s, is that the former have exceptions. For instance, flightless
                  birds are exceptions to the rule of thumb that birds can fly. One might hope to
                  represent this rule of thumb by the universal generalization "all non-flightless
                  birds can fly", but even this is not correct, for flighted birds with broken wings
                  cannot fly. One might still hope that some lengthy list of exceptions would do the
                  trick. However, one can imagine many different scenarios in which a bird would not
                  be able to fly: its feet are stuck in quicksand, all of the air around it has suddenly
                  rushed into space, it has developed a phobia about flying, etc. One might then try
                  to sum up this diversity of cases under the rubric of "untypical", or "abnormal",
                  and say: "All typical or normal birds can fly". This is exactly what a rule of thumb
                  is.
                  <p>
                    Rules of thumb differ from <a href="glossary.html#StatisticalGen">statistical generalization</a>s
                    such as "90% of birds can fly" in that there is no specific proportion of flighted
                    to flightless birds that determines normality. The rule of thumb doesn't even necessarily
                    imply that the majority of birds can fly, though it would be unusual if this didn't
                    hold. We can imagine, for instance, that there might be so many penguins in Antarctica
                    that the majority of birds would be flightless. However, our notion of normality
                    applies to the familiar, everyday birds we see in our backyards, rather than "exotics"
                    on distant continents. Clearly, then, rules of thumb are specific to a cultural
                    and temporal context.
                    <p>
                      The fallacy of Accident occurs when one either attempts to apply such a rule of
                      thumb to an obviously abnormal instance, or when one treats the rule itself as if
                      it were an exceptionless universal generalization, rather than a defeasible rule
                      of thumb.
