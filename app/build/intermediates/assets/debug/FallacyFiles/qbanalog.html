      <strong>x</strong> is similar to <strong>y</strong> (where the similarity depends
      for its strength upon some assumption which begs the question).
      <br />
      <strong>x</strong> is <strong>P</strong>.
      <br />
      Therefore, <strong>y</strong> is <strong>P</strong>.

          Do animals deserve the same respect as black people? That's the question posed in
          an online exhibit by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The exhibit pairs
          a slave auction with a cattle auction, two hanging black men with a hanging steer,
          herded Native Americans with herded cattle, a burning black man with a burning chicken,
          a shackled black ankle with a chained elephant hoof, and a pygmy in a zoo with a
          monkey in a dress.</blockquote>

            An <a href="glossary.html#ArgumentByAnalogy">analogical argument</a> begs the question
            when the strength of the analogy depends upon some controversial point at issue.
            <h3>
              Exposure:</h3>
            <p>
              Some animal rights supporters draw a detailed analogy between the treatment of nonhuman
              animals in contemporary America and the Jewish Holocaust of World War II. Slaughterhouses
              are compared to Nazi extermination camps, both of which involve large-scale killing
              through an efficient, assembly-line process. The <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
                conclusion</a> is that the treatment of animals is morally similar to the Holocaust
              perpetrated by the Nazis.
              <p>
                This <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a> begs an important question concerning
                the moral status of nonhuman animals. Of course, many advocates of animal rights
                and ethical vegetarianism consider all animals to be morally equal, so for them
                this is not a disanalogy. For the audience at whom such arguments are directed,
                however, there is a moral difference between human beings and other animals. In
                fact, much of the moral outrage at the Nazi atrocities comes from the treatment
                of Jews "like animals", as we say, violating their human dignity. Thus, without
                the underlying assumption of the moral equality of humans and other animals, the
                analogy between the Holocaust and so-called "factory farming" is superficial. If
                it is not wrong to kill animals for food, then it is not wrong to do so efficiently
                and in large numbers.
                <p>
                  This is not to deny that there is inhumane treatment of animals; rather, that there
                  is a moral equivalence between such inhumanity and the inhuman treatment of <em>persons</em>
                  in Auschwitz. Furthermore, if all animals are indeed morally equal, then killing
                  animals for food is equivalent to murder. However, this claim must be shown by a
                  separate argument, and cannot be established by the tendentious analogy with the
                  Holocaust, which depends logically upon it.

                    discuss this particular fallacy, but has the most detailed discussion of analogical
                    arguments and their fallacies of which I am aware.
