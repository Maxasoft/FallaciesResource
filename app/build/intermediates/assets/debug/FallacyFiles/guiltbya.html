      The most telling moment in last night's [State of the Union] speech came after the
      president noted that "key provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire next year."
      In response, notes the <cite>New York Times</cite>
    , "some critics in Congress applauded enthusiastically." If Osama bin Laden watched
    the speech, one imagines him applauding too.</blockquote>

          Exposition:</h3>
        <p>
          Guilt by Association is the attempt to discredit an idea based upon disfavored people
          or groups associated with it. This is the reverse of an <a href="authorit.html">Appeal
            to Misleading Authority</a>, and might be justly called "Appeal to Anti-Authority".
          An <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a> to authority argues <em>in favor</em>
          of an idea based upon associating an authority figure with the idea, whereas Guilt
          by Association argues <em>against</em> an idea based upon associating it with disreputable
          people or groups.

            Exposure:</h3>
          <p>
            McCarthyism was a specific version of Guilt by Association in which an individual,
            organization, or idea was associated in some way with communism. An association
            was made between the target of McCarthyism and communism by linking both through
            some shared idea. For instance, in the 1960s some anti-communists attacked support
            for civil rights by pointing out that the Communist Party of the United States also
            supported the civil rights movement. It was then argued that anyone who supported
            civil rights was thereby supporting communism, whether they intended to or not.
            Here is the form of the argument:
            <table cellpadding="4">

                <th>

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  Martin Luther King, Jr.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Support for civil rights
                </td>
                <td>
                  Communism
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
              This can be reformulated as a <a href="glossary.html#CategoricalSyll">categorical
                syllogism</a> as follows:
              <p>
                All communists are civil rights supporters.
                <br />
                Martin Luther King, Jr. is a civil rights supporter.
                <br />
                Therefore, Martin Luther King, Jr. is a communist.
                <p>
                  This argument commits a syllogistic <a href="undismid.html">fallacy</a>, and many
                  other instances of Guilt by Association commit the same fallacy.

                    <p>
                      That Osama bin Laden might approve of the expiration of provisions of the Patriot
                      Act does not show that American critics are wrong to also approve, since the reasons
                      for their approval are different. Some Americans oppose parts of the Patriot Act
                      because they believe that it infringes upon the rights of Americans without significantly
                      helping to prevent terrorism. They may be wrong, but that doesn't make them an al
                      Qaeda cheering squad.

                        Reader Response:</h3>
                      <p>
                        Reader Dale Liop writes in response to the above analysis:
                        <blockquote>
                          It seems to me the author's point is not that the critics are wrong just because
                          Osama bin Laden might be applauding with them. Rather, I think his implicit point
                          is that by removing the Patriot Act, terrorists like Osama bin Laden will be able
                          to commit crimes of terrorism more easily. For this reason, the author is saying,
                          Osama bin laden would be clapping too, and so that's why the critics are mistaken
                          in their position. I think calling the critics the al Qaeda Cheering Squad and mentioning
                          bin Laden would applaud with them was for rhetorical effect only, to make his point
                          come across more effectively. So, I do not think the author commits a fallacy because
                          the association between bin Laden and the critics is not his real point.</blockquote>
                        <p>
                          Dale, in logically analyzing an example, it is important to focus upon the argument
                          itself and not the arguer. It is not a good idea to try to read the arguer's mind,
                          or guess his intentions. There are many reasons why an arguer may commit a fallacy:
                          he may be mistaken, he may intend to deceive his audience, or he may be making a
                          joke.
                          <p>
                            Another reason is a type of rhetorical overstatement: for instance, a person who
                            is hungry may say "I'm starving!" What the person says is literally false, and they
                            know that it's false, but they're not lying because they're not trying to deceive.
                            Rather, they are emphasizing that they are very hungry. Similarly, people may fallaciously
                            draw extreme <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">conclusions</a> that are not supported
                            by the evidence as a way of emphasizing a point.
                            <p>
                              So, evaluating an argument as <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>
                              is not a judgment pronounced upon its author, but simply a judgment of the argument
                              itself. In the example, Taranto may well have been joking or using rhetorical overstatement
                              when he called the applauders an al Qaeda cheering squad, but that doesn't make
                              the implicit argument&#8213;that because the applauders and bin Laden are both against
                              the Patriot Act, then the applauders must be for al Qaeda&#8213;any less fallacious.
