    What are the Fallacy files?</h1>
  <p>
    I began collecting and studying logical fallacies about twenty-five years ago, when
    I first became interested in logic. This collection took two forms:
    <ol>
      <li>A collection of named fallacies&#151such as "<a href="adhomine.html">ad hominem</a>"&#151that
        is, types of bad reasoning which someone has thought distinctive and interesting
        enough to name and describe. This collection took the form, primarily, of the study
        and acquisition of books and articles on the named fallacies, especially textbooks
        and reference books. You can find individual files on the named fallacies via the
        <a href="taxonomy.html">Taxonomy of Logical Fallacies</a>, or from the alphabetical
        index in the scroll bar to your left.
        <li>A collection of fallacious, or otherwise bad, arguments, that is, examples of
          reasoning which may commit one or more of the named fallacies under 1, or are bad
          in some way yet to be classified. This collection took the form of clippings from
          newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, photocopies of pages of books, and&#151in a few
          rare cases&#151entire articles or books which were rich sources of bad reasoning.
          I have used selections from my collection as examples in many of the files on named
          fallacies, and additional examples can be found in the file: <a href="examples.html">
            Stalking the Wild Fallacy</a>.</ol>
    <p>
      Some years after I began to amass these files, I wondered just what I ought eventually
      to do with them, how best to organize the information within them, and in what form
      to make them available to others interested in fallacy studies. The present hypertext
      web version, <cite>The Fallacy Files</cite>, was first published on March 11th,
      2001, and is the result of this score of years of research and fieldwork on the
      fallacies.

            Any examples sent to <cite>The Fallacy Files</cite> or questions asked may be used
            in entries, the weblog, or other features. I will acknowledge the contributor of
            examples or questions unless otherwise instructed. If you do not want a submission

            answer all email, but due to the volume&#8213;especially of spam&#8213;and other
            responsibilities, I may be slow in doing so. I appreciate your taking the time and
            trouble to write.

              <a name="AdPolicy">Advertisement Policy</a></h3>
            <p>
              Advertisements help support the continuing mission of <cite>The Fallacy Files</cite>
              to rid the universe of fallacious arguments, and readers can help support that mission
              by visiting those advertisers. However, <cite>The Fallacy Files</cite> does not
              endorse the products or books advertised on this site.
              <p>
                I provide <cite>Amazon</cite> links to books for a number of reasons: Sometimes
                I endorse the books, but sometimes I link to a book that I disagree with so that
                readers can easily check what I say about it. This is an extension of the scholarly
                practice of citing sources, since sometimes the easiest, fastest, or only way to
                check a citation to a book is to purchase it. Other times I link to books that I
                haven't read or disagree with so that readers can find an alternative point of view.
                Thus, an <cite>Amazon</cite> link to a book should not be taken as an endorsement,
                but any purchase you make through such a link will help support <cite>The Fallacy
                  Files</cite>. Thank you for your continued support!
                <p>
                  If you are interested in advertising to a smart readership interested in logical
                  fallacies, cognitive biases, statistical errors, logic puzzles, and new books on
                  these and related issues, please <a href="mailto:fallacist@fallacyfiles.org?subject=Advertising on the Fallacy Files">
