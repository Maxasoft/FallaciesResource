    <blockquote>
      The elements of the moral argument on the status of unborn life&#133strongly favor
      the conclusion that this unborn segment of humanity has a right not to be killed,
      at least. Without laying out all the evidence here, it is fair to conclude from
      medicine that the humanity of the life growing in a mother's womb is undeniable
      and, in itself, a powerful reason for treating the unborn with respect.</blockquote>

          Counter-Example:</h3>
        <p>
          The humanity of the patient's appendix is medically undeniable.
          <br />
          Therefore, the appendix has a right to life and should not be surgically removed.
          <h3>
            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            Equivocation is the type of <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguity" title="The state of having more than one meaning.">
              ambiguity</a> which occurs when a single word or phrase is <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguous"
                title="Having more than one meaning.">ambiguous</a>, and this ambiguity is not
            grammatical but lexical. So, when a phrase equivocates, it is not due to grammar,
            but to the phrase as a whole having two distinct meanings.
            <p>
              Of course, most words are ambiguous, but context usually makes a univocal meaning
              clear. Also, equivocation alone is not <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious" title="Committing a logical fallacy.">
                fallacious</a>, though it <em>is</em> a linguistic <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap"
                  title="A linguistic snare that may cause someone to commit a fallacy.">boobytrap</a>
              which can trip people into committing a fallacy. The <em>Fallacy</em> of Equivocation
              occurs when an equivocal word or phrase makes an unsound <a href="glossary.html#Argument"
                title="A unit of reasoning.">argument</a> appear <a href="glossary.html#Sound" title="Being valid with all true premisses.">
                  sound</a>. Consider the following example:
              <p>
                All banks are beside rivers.
                <br />
                Therefore, the financial institution where I deposit my money is beside a river.
                <p>
                  In this argument, there are two unrelated meanings of the word "bank":
                  <ol>
                    <li><em>A riverside</em>: In this sense, the <a href="glossary.html#Premiss" title="A statement in an argument that provides evidence for the conclusion.">
                      premiss</a> is true but the argument is in<a href="glossary.html#Valid" title="Necessarily truth-preserving.">valid</a>,
                      so it's unsound.
                      <li><em>A type of financial institution</em>: On this meaning, the argument is
                    valid, but the premiss is false, thus the argument is again unsound.</ol>
                  <p>
                    In either case, the argument is unsound. Therefore, no argument which commits the
                    fallacy of Equivocation is sound.

                      Newspaper headlines, because they are so short, have to be written carefully to
                      avoid equivocation; here are some amusing examples which failed to do so:

                            This argument equivocates on the word "humanity"&#151"the condition of being human"&#151which
                            means "of, &#133 or characteristic of mankind" (<cite>The Random House College Dictionary</cite>,
                            Revised Edition, 1975). The two relevant meanings here are:
                            <ol>
                              <li>"of&#133mankind", meaning being a member of the human species.
                                <li>"characteristic of mankind". For instance, the "<em>human</em>
                              heart" is "human" in this sense, since it is not a human being, but is the kind
                              of heart characteristic of human beings.</ol>
                            <p>
                              Applying this to Alvar&eacute's argument, it is true that the "humanity" of an embryo
                              or fetus is medically undeniable, in the second sense of "human"&#151that is, it
                              is a "<em>human</em> embryo or fetus". It is, however, an equivocation on "human"
                              to conclude, as Alvar&eacute did, that it "has a right not to be killed". Parts
                              of the human body are "human" in this sense, but it is only a whole human being
                              who has a right to life.

                                <blockquote>
                                  In your first example of an equivocation fallacy, the counter example has a bit
                                  of faulty reasoning. An appendix is undoubtedly human but, having the same genes
                                  as the rest of the body, can be empirically proven to be a part of the host body.
                                  A fetus, however, has unique genetics that show (also empirically) that it is a
                                  separate life form, dependent though it is on its host. This seems to be a fallacy
                                  of accident in that you argue:
                                  <blockquote>
                                    Organs are living components in a body. Fetuses are living and in a body. Therefore,
                                    fetuses are equivalent to organs.</blockquote>
                                </blockquote>

                                  A <a href="glossary.html#CounterExample" title="An example designed to show that an argument has a non-validating form.">
                                    counter-example</a> to an example argument is an argument with the same logical
                                  form, but obviously true premisses and a false <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion"
                                    title="The part of an argument for which evidence is provided.">conclusion</a>.
                                  Because the counter-example argument has true premisses and a false conclusion,
                                  it must be invalid. Since the counter-example has the same logical form as the example
                                  argument, this shows that the example lacks a <a href="glossary.html#Validating"
                                    title="Of a logical form every instance of which is valid.">validating</a> form.
                                  In the case of a counter-example to an example of an informal fallacy, the counter-example
                                  must also commit the same type of fallacy.
                                  <p>
                                    The specific Counter-Example above has only one premiss: "The humanity of the patient's
                                    appendix is medically undeniable." This is undeniably true, assuming that the patient
                                    is a human being, who will therefore have a human appendix. The conclusion of the
                                    Counter-Example is: "The appendix has a right to life and should not be surgically
                                    removed," which I presume is uncontroversially false.
                                    <p>
                                      I'm not claiming that a fetus is a part of its mother's body, and the only sense
                                      in which I'm claiming that the fetus and an organ are "equivalent" is that the "humanity"
                                      of both is "undeniable." Since the argument in question is an example of the fallacy
                                      of equivocation, there are two senses of "humanity", one of which implies a right
                                      to life and another which doesn't. Clearly, the sense in which an appendix is human
                                      does not imply that it has a right to life.
                                      <p>
                                        In which sense is the "humanity" of the fetus "undeniable"? If the sense involved
                                        is that which does not imply a right to life, then the argument is invalid; if the
                                        sense is that which does imply a right to life, then the argument is valid. However,
                                        in that sense of "humanity", the "humanity" of the fetus is not undeniable, and
                                        many do deny it.
                                        <p>
                                          Finally, I don't see how the fallacy of accident is relevant.
