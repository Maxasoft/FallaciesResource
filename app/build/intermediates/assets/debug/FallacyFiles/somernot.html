            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            To understand the nature of this fallacy, one needs to know the difference between
            logical <em>implication</em> and conversational <em>implicature</em>:
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Implication:</strong> This is a relation between <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">
                proposition</a>s, that is, the meanings of statements.
                <li><strong>Implicature:</strong>
              This is a relation between the fact that someone makes a statement and a proposition.</ol>
            <p>
              For example, suppose that I state that today is Sunday and it's raining. This statement
              logically <em>implies</em> that it's raining. In contrast, the fact that I made
              the statement <em>implicates</em> that I believe that it's raining. The statement
              taken by itself implies nothing about what I believe; rather, it is the <em>fact</em>
              that I made the statement which implicates that I believe it.
              <p>
                Why does the fact that I made the statement implicate that I believe it? All conversational
                implicature is based on certain rules (or "maxims", as the philosopher Paul Grice
                called them) which govern cooperative communication. One of these rules is that
                you should state only what you believe (which Grice called a maxim of "Quality").
                Thus, from the fact that I state something, you can conclude that I believe it.
                Of course, I might be lying, but conversational implicature is based upon the presumption
                that people are trying to cooperate, and thus are obeying the rules.
                <p>
                  How does this relate to the Fallacy of Some Are/Some Are Not? There is another rule
                  of conversation (called by Grice a maxim of "Quantity") that one should make statements
                  as logically strong as is consistent with telling the truth (Quality). So, while
                  a statement of the form "Some <strong>S</strong> are <strong>P</strong>" does not
                  logically imply "Some <strong>S</strong> are not <strong>P</strong>", the fact that
                  someone makes the former statement conversationally implicates the latter. In other
                  words, if one knows that <em>all</em> <strong>S</strong> are <strong>P</strong>
                  one should say so, and the fact that one says only that <em>some</em> are implicates
                  that one does not believe that <em>all</em> are. This latter fact, together with
                  the assumption that you know what you're talking about (Quality, again), implicates
                  that not all <strong>S</strong> are <strong>P</strong>.
                  <p>
                    Thus, the theory of conversational implicature explains how it is possible to mislead&#151if
                    not actually lie&#151while still speaking the literal truth; by means of what we
                    call "half-truths", we can implicate falsehoods with our statements. If we know
                    that all <strong>S</strong> are <strong>P</strong>, then the statement that <em>some</em>
                    are is a half-truth. Half-truths are wholly true, since truth and falsity do not
                    come in degrees, but they are misleading because they violate norms of efficient
                    communication. Hence, the legal oath to tell the truth (Quality), the <em>whole truth</em>
                    (Quantity), and nothing but the truth (Quality, again).
                    <p>
                      So, what is the Fallacy of Some Are/Some Are Not? It is the mistake of confusing
                      logical implication and conversational implicature by thinking that "some are" statements
                      logically imply "some are not" statements, when the former statements only conversationally
                      implicate the latter.
