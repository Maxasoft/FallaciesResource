          Exposition:</h3>
        <p>
          There are two types of overgenerality:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Overly-General Concepts:</strong> No concept is inherently overly general,
              but in a particular context of use it may be. For instance, if you were asked to
              aid in a search, it wouldn't be helpful to be told to look for a "thing". In this
              context, "thing" is an overly-general concept, since it won't help you to identify
              the lost object. Overly-general concepts are often used by politicians as a way
              to avoid commitment to particular policies, which is a type of "doublespeak".
              <li><strong>Overly-Broad Generalizations:</strong> To generalize is to draw a general
                <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion" title="A proposition for which evidence is provided.">
                  conclusion</a> from some evidence. To <em>over</em>generalize is to draw an overly-general
                conclusion that is unwarranted by the evidence. For instance, if I have seen only
                one swan and it was white, "all swans are white" would be an overgeneralization.
                Specifically, it would be an instance of the <a href="glossary.html#Subfallacy" title="A fallacy that is a specific type of a more general fallacy.">
                  subfallacy</a>
            of Hasty Generalization.</ol>
          <h3>
            Exposure:</h3>
          <p>
            Overgenerality should not be confused with either <a href="glossary.html#Vagueness"
              title="Having borderline cases.">vagueness</a> or abstractness:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Vagueness:</strong> Concepts which are imprecise because of overgenerality
                are often called "vague". However, overgenerality and vagueness are two different
                types of imprecision. A concept is vague when there are borderline cases of its
                application, whereas an overly-general concept may not be vague. Similarly, a vague
                concept need not be overly general; for instance, the concept of "chair" is vague,
                because there are borderline cases such as beanbag chairs and barstools, but it
                is not an overly-general concept for the object upon which I sit&#8213;"furniture",
                in contrast, probably would be overly general.
                <li><strong>Abstractness:</strong> Abstraction is a very different concept from overgenerality.
                  Abstract objects are nonphysical objects that lack spatial or temporal locations.
                  For instance, numbers are abstract objects: you can't touch a number, nor point
                  to where it's located, nor give its date of origin. There are general concepts for
                  both abstract and physical objects. "Number" is a general concept for a type of
                  abstract object, whereas "chair" is a general concept for a type of physical object.
                  <p>
                    Highly general concepts may be confused with abstractions because the physical objects
                    that we experience are always instances of highly specific concepts. For instance,
                    we never see just an "animal", we see a cat or a dog or a member of some other species.
                    This may lead us to think that "animal" is an abstract concept, but animals are
                    physical objects with a location, come into existence at a particular time, and
                    leave it at a later one.
                    <p>
              Another difference between generality and abstraction is that the former is a comparative
              notion, whereas the latter is not. Some concepts are more general than others: for
              instance, "mammal" is a more general concept than "cat", but a more specific concept
              than "animal". In contrast, a concept is either an abstraction or it isn't; no concept
              is more abstract than another.</ul>

              <a name="Analysis">Analysis of the Example:</a></h3>
            <p>
              Bain, who was at the time of this letter a publicist for Michael Jackson, was overly
              general in describing Jackson's supposed sales of 750 million "units". What is a
              "unit": a record, a song, or some combination of the two? A number of news organizations,
              including the BBC, apparently thought that a "unit" was an album, and reported it
              as a "fact" that Jackson had sold 750 million albums. Thus, Bain's over-general
              characterization of Jackson's sales led some news organizations to draw an unwarranted
              conclusion.
