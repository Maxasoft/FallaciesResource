    Familiar Contextomies</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>Introduction:</strong> A contextomy is a quote that has been taken out of
    context in such a way as to create a misleading impression of its meaning. A "familiar
    contextomy" is a contextomy that finds its way repeatedly into print or conversation,
    usually to support a particular point.
    <p>
      You will not find the following types of misleading quotes here:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bogus Quotes:</strong> Quotes that have been fabricated and falsely attributed.
          <li><strong>Misattributions:</strong> Quotes attributed to the wrong person.
            <li><strong>Misquotes:</strong> Garbled quotes that are similar to what the quoted
              person actually said.
              <li><strong>Mistranslations:</strong>
        Quotes garbled in translation.</ul>
      <p>
        What you will find are accurate quotes that give a false impression when removed
        from their context, together with that context. Moreover, each example has been
        used to advance some <a href="glossary.html#Argument" title="A unit of reasoning.">
          argument</a>, thus committing the fallacy of quoting out of context. If you know
        of any familiar contextomies that should be included, wonder whether some quote
        is in fact a contextomy, or have any comments or questions about this feature, <a
          href="mailto:fallacist@fallacyfiles.org?subject=Familiar Contextomies">please let
          me know</a>.

            <a name="Adams">John Adams</a></h2>
            <h4>
              Contextomy:</h4>
            <blockquote>
              This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it!</blockquote>
            <p>
              <strong>Exposition:</strong> This quote is sometimes cited by people who argue against
              religion and want to appeal to Adams' authority, or who use the quote as evidence
              that the Founding Fathers were opposed to religion.
              <h4>
                Context:</h4>
              <blockquote>
                Twenty times, in the course of my late Reading, have I been upon the point of breaking
                out, "<span style="background-color: yellow;">This would be the best of all possible
                  Worlds, if there were no Religion in it</span>"!!! But in this exclamati[on] I
                should have been as fanatical as Bryant or Cleverly [Adams' boyhood parish priest
                and Latin school master]. Without Religion this World would be Something not fit
                to be mentioned in polite Company, I mean Hell.</blockquote>
              <p>
                <strong>Exposure:</strong> The contextomy is in quotation marks in Adams' letter,
                which is an important part of the context, since it shows that Adams is not endorsing
                that sentiment, but in fact rejecting it.

                        <strong>Exposition:</strong> This quote has been used repeatedly by people who opposed
                        the invasion of Iraq, and who use it as evidence that the Bush administration had
                        justified that invasion on the basis of Iraq possessing nuclear weapons.
                        <h4>
                          Context:</h4>
                        <blockquote>
                          <strong>Tim Russert:</strong> What do you think is the most important rationale
                          for going to war with Iraq?
                          <p>
                            <strong>Cheney:</strong> Well, I think I've just given it, Tim, in terms of the
                            combination of his development and use of chemical weapons, his development of biological
                            weapons, his pursuit of nuclear weapons.
                            <p>
                              <strong>Russert:</strong> And even though the International Atomic Energy Agency
                              said he does not have a nuclear program, we disagree?
                              <p>
                                <strong>Cheney:</strong> I disagree, yes. &#133 Let's talk about the nuclear proposition
                                for a minute. &#133 In the late '70s, Saddam Hussein acquired nuclear reactors from
                                the French. 1981, the Israelis took out the Osirak reactor and stopped his nuclear
                                weapons development at the time. Throughout the '80s, he mounted a new effort. I
                                was told when I was defense secretary before the Gulf War that he was eight to 10
                                years away from a nuclear weapon. And we found out after the Gulf War that he was
                                within one or two years of having a nuclear weapon because he had a massive effort
                                under way that involved four or five different technologies for enriching uranium
                                to produce fissile material. We know that based on intelligence that he has been
                                very, very good at hiding these kinds of efforts. He's had years to get good at
                                it and we know he has been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons.
                                And <span style="background-color: yellow;">we believe he has, in fact, reconstituted
                                  nuclear weapons.</span>

                        <p>
                          <strong>Exposure:</strong> The context makes it clear that Cheney was claiming&#8213;probably
                          falsely&#8213;that Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons <em>program</em>,
                          not that it had acquired actual nuclear weapons. Most contextomies get passed around
                          among advocates of a position to the point that their original source is obscured.
                          This is a rare contextomy whose source is known, namely, an article by Dana Milbank
                          that appeared the day after the interview from which the quote was contextomized.
                          Milbank later used the quote in the "Verbatim" feature of his column, and a correction
                          from Cheney's office was soon appended, but it was too late. The contextomy had
                          metastasized, spreading so rapidly among critics of the war in Iraq that it was
                          impossible to stop, no matter how often or publicly it was corrected.

                                <blockquote>
                                  I understand the subtle nuance of shifting from the prior statement that referred
                                  to the <em>program</em> and the quotes used to discredit him were made clear by
                                  the context that he really meant the <em>program</em>. What I am having a problem
                                  rectifying is who is really guilty of what.
                                  <p>
                                    The context could be linked to the <em>programs</em>, which as you aptly point out
                                    was most likely a false claim by Cheney, but the way it is written he could have
                                    very well been using the same contextomy rather than the people spinning what he
                                    had said.
                                    <p>
                                      Mr. Cheney seems to be rather well versed in contextomies as evident in even his
                                      everyday speech but especially in a political forum. You pointed out that his people
                                      were quick to "append" his comment, but as I see it that could have been required
                                      more because the people misunderstood what he said to be actually what he was trying
                                      to convey with his statement. As I read the statement, it suggests to me that he
                                      is suggesting exactly that Saddam had indeed acquired nuclear weapons by some method,
                                      possibly by reconstituting them.
                                      <p>
                                        I am not sure if my explanation is exactly clear as if this is a double (or maybe
                                        triple with the appended statement) contextomy, let me give you an example of one
                                        that seems to parallel what I am trying to say. If you are a tourist around Jackson
                                        Square, you may very well be approached and challenged with this statement, "I bet
                                        you a dollar that I can tell you where you got them shoes" as he points to the shoes
                                        you are wearing. Of course, since there is no way for this stranger to know where
                                        you are from or where you actually bought your shoes, you take the bet. Well, you
                                        will lose as the response after the challenge is accepted is, "You got your shoes
                                        on your feet." The challenger is setting you up to fall into the contextomy. The
                                        mark assumes that he is talking about the context of where you purchased your shoes
                                        but the bet is lost because the mark did not realize that he was being set up with
                                        a misleading question.

                                          In this example, Cheney is trying to suggest that Saddam has nuclear weapons but
                                          not be caught in a direct lie, so he offers a contextomy to protect himself. He
                                          was, however, so clever in his statement that his statement taken exactly as he
                                          said it does indeed fit either position. He could be meaning that he has nuclear
                                          weapons or he could be saying that he has a reconstituted nuclear weapons program,
                                          which would have been enough to scare the public into giving him support. But since
                                          he walked too much on that slippery slope, he was caught in his own contextomy and
                                          had to append his statement.

                                  Now, I realize that this is a very fine point, but I would like to know if I am
                                  understanding this example correctly or if I am mistaken in the way I see this example
                                  being only half of what I consider an obvious example of some sort of double spin
                                  by a master in political spinning that was just not perfect enough to get by. I
                                  think that he said exactly what he meant to convey. I think that his only problem
                                  was that when he accidentally said exactly what he wanted people to think, he had
                                  to append it to have a way to claim not to have outright lied to bring us into the
                                  war that ensued at least partially because of this contextomy. We are still paying
                                  for it both in our economy and in the lives of the victims and their families.&#8213;Lemuel

                                  First of all, a technical point: The sucker bet example is amusing but not really
                                  a contextomy. Rather, the con artist is equivocating on the word "got", which can
                                  mean either "bought" or "physically located". The "mark" interprets the bet as a
                                  challenge to guess where the shoes were purchased, which is a good bet for the mark;
                                  whereas, the con artist intends the challenge to be to guess where the shoes are
                                  physically located, which is a sure thing. However, I take your point to be that
                                  Cheney was using an <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguous" title="Having more than one meaning.">
                                    ambiguous</a> statement to trick people into thinking that Saddam Hussein had
                                  acquired nuclear weapons.
                                  <p>
                                    Now, not only did Cheney's office issue a clarification the next day of what he
                                    said, but Cheney himself later claimed that he misspoke (see the Resource, above,
                                    for 9/14/2003). I suppose if Cheney came out and admitted that he intentionally
                                    dropped the word "program" in an attempt to mislead the American people into war
                                    with Iraq, that you would believe him. However, I can't see what would constitute
                                    evidence that he misspoke that you wouldn't reject. When Cheney says that he misspoke,
                                    you think that is a lie. So, it's hard for me to imagine what kind of evidence&#8213;in
                                    addition to what I've already given above, or is available in the Resources that
                                    I linked to&#8213;you would accept. In other words, it seems that your position
                                    is: heads you win, tails I lose. That's confirmation bias on steroids!
                                    <p>
                                      The only thing that I can think to add is that the claim that he intended to mislead
                                      people into thinking that Iraq had already acquired nuclear weapons is implausible.
                                      If the goal was supposed to be to convince people that a war with Iraq was a good
                                      idea, such a claim could easily backfire. If Iraq actually possessed an atomic bomb,
                                      it could've inflicted massive casualties upon allied soldiers, an American city,
                                      or perhaps an Israeli city. Such a prospect, if taken seriously, would've been enough
                                      to turn many people against the invasion. That said, since your claim seems to be
                                      unfalsifiable, it's a sucker bet to try to falsify it.
                                      <p>
                                        My primary purpose here was not to defend Cheney, but to point out that this was
                                        a quote taken misleadingly out of context. I can't read Cheney's mind now, let alone
                                        several years ago, so the only thing I know about his intentions is what he says
                                        and what seems plausible. However, whatever Cheney's intentions, the way in which
                                        the quote was used was still a contextomy, since it was frequently quoted without
                                        any of the context of the interview or of Cheney's later clarifications (see the
                                        Resources, above, for multiple examples). Secondarily, I wanted to point out that
                                        adopting a position that is unfalsifiable, while perhaps not a fallacy, is at least
                                        a questionable procedure in argument. You can't reasonably expect people to argue
                                        with you if you reject any evidence against your position as a lie.
