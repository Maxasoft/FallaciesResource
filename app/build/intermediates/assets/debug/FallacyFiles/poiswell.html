  <strong>Etymology:</strong>
  <p>
    The phrase "poisoning the well" ultimately alludes to the medieval European myth
    that the black plague was caused by Jews poisoning town wells&#151a myth which was
    used as an excuse to persecute Jews.
    <p>
      The phrase was first used in its relevant sense by Cardinal John Henry Newman during
      a controversy with Charles Kingsley:
      <blockquote>
        &#133[W]hat I insist upon here&#133is this unmanly attempt of his, in his concluding
        pages, to cut the ground from under my feet;&#151to poison by anticipation the public
        mind against me, John Henry Newman, and to infuse into the imaginations of my readers,
        suspicion and mistrust of every thing that I may say in reply to him. This I call
        poisoning the wells.
        <p>
          "I am henceforth in doubt and fear," he says, "as much as any honest man can be,
          concerning every word Dr. Newman may write. How can I tell that I shall not be the
          dupe of some cunning equivocation?" &#133

          <p>
        Well, I can only say, that, if his taunt is to take effect, I am but wasting my
        time in saying a word in answer to his foul calumnies&#133 We all know how our imagination
        runs away with us, how suddenly and at what a pace;&#151the saying, "Caesar's wife
        should not be suspected," is an instance of what I mean. The habitual prejudice,
        the humour of the moment, is the turning-point which leads us to read a defence
        in a good sense or a bad. We interpret it by our antecedent impressions. The very
        same sentiments, according as our jealousy is or is not awake, or our aversion stimulated,
        are tokens of truth or of dissimulation and pretence. There is a story of a sane
        person being by mistake shut up in the wards of a Lunatic Asylum, and that, when
        he pleaded his cause to some strangers visiting the establishment, the only remark
        he elicited in answer was, "How naturally he talks! you would think he was in his
        senses." Controversies should be decided by the reason; is it legitimate warfare
        to appeal to the misgivings of the public mind and to its dislikings? Any how, if
        Mr. Kingsley is able thus to practise upon my readers, the more I succeed, the less
        will be my success. &#133 The more triumphant are my statements, the more certain
        will be my defeat.</blockquote>

                Exposition:</h3>
              <p>
                To poison the well is to commit a pre-emptive <em>ad hominem</em> strike against
                an argumentative opponent. As with regular <em>ad hominem</em>s, the well may be
                poisoned in either an abusive or circumstantial way. For instance:
                <ol>
                  <li>"Only an ignoramus would disagree with fluoridating water." (Abusive)
                    <li>
                  "My opponent is a dentist, so of course he will oppose the fluoridating of water,
                  since he will lose business." (Circumstantial)</ol>
                <p>
                  Anyone bold enough to enter a debate which begins with a well-poisoning either steps
                  into an insult, or an attack upon one's personal integrity. As with standard <em>ad
                    hominem</em>s, the debate is likely to cease to be about its nominal topic and
                  become a debate about the arguer. However, what sets Poisoning the Well apart from
                  the standard Ad Hominem is the fact that the poisoning is done <em>before</em> the
                  opponent has a chance to make a case.
                  <h3>
                    Exposure:</h3>
                  <p>
                    Poisoning the Well is not, strictly speaking, a logical fallacy since it is not
                    a type of <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>. Rather, it is a logical
                    <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap">boobytrap</a> set by the poisoner to tempt the
                    unwary audience into committing an <em>ad hominem</em> fallacy. As with all forms
                    of the <em>ad hominem</em>, one should keep in mind that an argument can and must
                    stand or fall on its own, regardless of who makes it.
                    <h3>
                      <a name="Analysis">Analysis of the Example:</a></h3>
                    <p>
                      This is a common type of circumstantial poisoning of the well, which claims that
                      men should either not make a judgment about abortion, or should keep it to themselves
                      if they do. This illustrates the effect that poisoning the well tends to have, which
                      is to forestall opposition in debate. It also shows the mistake underlying all poisoning
                      of the well, since the sex of the arguer is irrelevant to the merits of the argument.
                      No doubt one could always find a woman to advance the argument, whatever it is.
