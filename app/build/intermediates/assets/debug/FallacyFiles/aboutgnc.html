  <p>
    I have a doctoral degree in philosophy from Indiana University in Bloomington, where
    I majored in logic. My dissertation concerned the concept of logical form, and touched
    on the subject of formal fallacies. I have taught philosophy and logic at both the
    undergraduate and graduate levels at I.U.B., Indiana University-Purdue University
    at Indianapolis&#8212known affectionately as "Ooey-Pooey"&#8212and Indiana State
    University. For five years, I worked as an ontologist for the artificial intelligence
    company <a href="http://www.cyc.com">Cycorp, Inc.</a> in Austin, Texas.</p>

    Comments and suggestions on these files are welcome. I am particularly interested
    in real-life examples of fallacious arguments drawn from the media, and will consider
    for inclusion fallacies that are not yet listed in the files. If you know of any
    external resources that these files should link to, please let me know of them.
    All suggestions or submissions that I use will be duly acknowledged. I will assume
    that all email is intended for publication, unless notified to the contrary. If
    you wish to have your name withheld, please inform me to that effect in the email.</p>
