    <h3>
      Exposition:</h3>
    <p>
      The categorical syllogism is part of the oldest system of formal logic, invented
      by the first formal logician, Aristotle. There are several techniques devised to
      test syllogistic forms for validation, including sets of rules, diagrams, and even
      mnemonic poems.
      <p>
        More importantly for us, there are sets of fallacies based upon the rules such that
        any syllogism which does not commit any of the fallacies will have a validating
        form. The <a href="glossary.html#Subfallacy">subfallacies</a> of Syllogistic Fallacy
        are fallacies of this rule-breaking type. If a categorical syllogism commits none
        of the subfallacies below, then it has a validating form. To understand these subfallacies,
        it is necessary to understand some basic terminology about categorical syllogisms:
        <h3>
          A Short Introduction to Categorical Syllogisms:</h3>
        <p>
          A <em>categorical syllogism</em> is a type of argument with two <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">
            premiss</a>es&#151that is, a <em>syllogism</em>&#151and one <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
              conclusion</a>. Each of these three <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">proposition</a>s
          is one of four forms of categorical proposition:

            These four types of proposition are called <strong>A</strong>, <strong>E</strong>,
            <strong>I</strong>, and <strong>O</strong> type propositions, as indicated. The
            variables, <strong>S</strong> and <strong>P</strong>, are place-holders for <a href="glossary.html#Term">
              term</a>s which pick out a class&#151or <em>category</em>&#151of thing; hence
            the name "categorical" proposition.
            <p>
              In a categorical syllogism there are three terms, two in each premiss, and two occurrences
              of each term in the entire argument, for a total of six occurrences. The <strong>S</strong>
              and <strong>P</strong> which occur in its conclusion&#151the <strong>S</strong>ubject
              and <strong>P</strong>redicate terms&#151are also called the "minor" and "major"
              terms, respectively. The major term occurs once in one of the premisses, which is
              therefore called the "major" premiss. The minor term also occurs once in the other
              premiss, which is for this reason called the "minor" premiss. The third term occurs
              once in each premiss, but not in the conclusion, and is called the "middle" term.
              <p>
                The notion of <a href="glossary.html#Distribution">distribution</a> plays a role
                in some of the syllogistic fallacies: the terms in a categorical proposition are
                said to be "distributed" or "undistributed" in that proposition, depending upon
                what type of proposition it is, and whether the term is the subject or predicate
                term. Specifically, the subject term is distributed in the <strong>A</strong> and
                <strong>E</strong> type propositions, and the predicate term is distributed in the
                <strong>E</strong> and <strong>O</strong> type propositions. The other terms are
                undistributed. In the table above, the distributed terms are in <b>bold</b>, and
                the undistributed ones are in <i>italic</i>.
                <p>
                  Finally, the <strong>A</strong> and <strong>I</strong> type propositions are called
                  "affirmative" propositions, while the <strong>E</strong> and <strong>O</strong>
                  type are "negative", for reasons which should be obvious. Now, you should be equiped
                  to understand the following types of syllogistic fallacy.
