    The Four Term Fallacy</h1>
  <strong>Alias:</strong> Quaternio Terminorum
  <p>
    <strong>Type:</strong> <a href="syllfall.html">Syllogistic Fallacy</a></p>
  <h3>
    Form:</h3>
  <p>
    A two <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a> <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
      argument</a> containing four <a href="glossary.html#Term">term</a>s, which results
    from a <a href="glossary.html#Validating">validating</a> <a href="glossary.html#CategoricalSyll">
      syllogistic</a> form by substituting two distinct terms for one variable.</p>
  <h3>
    Example:</h3>
  <p>
    No Republicans are Democrats.
    <br />
    All conservatives are Republicans.
    <br />
    Therefore, no conservatives are democrats.</p>

  <h3>
    Syllogistic Rule Violated:</h3>
  <p>
    All <a href="glossary.html#Valid">valid</a> categorical syllogisms have exactly
    three terms.</p>
  <h3>
    Exposition:</h3>
  <p>
    A categorical syllogism is, by definition, an argument with three categorical terms.
    "Term" is to be understood in a semantic sense, as opposed to the syntactic sense
    of "word" or "phrase". In other words, it is the meaning of the words that is important.
    So, two different words with the same meaning are the same term, and the same word
    occurring twice with different meanings is two distinct terms. An argument commits
    the Four Term Fallacy which appears to have the form of a validating categorical
    syllogism, but has four terms.</p>
  <p>
    For this reason, the Four Term Fallacy differs from the other Syllogistic Fallacies,
    each of which involves genuine categorical syllogisms which violate one or more
    of the rules for syllogisms. The Four Term Fallacy, in contrast, involves arguments
    which fail to be categorical syllogisms because of too many terms.</p>
  <h3>
    Exposure:</h3>
  <p>
    One might wonder why there is no "Five Term" fallacy, and theoretically a form which
    resembles a categorical syllogism can have as many as six terms. However, an argument
    with so many terms would be unlikely to fool anyone into thinking that it was a
    categorical syllogism. Of course, this raises the question of how an argument with
    even one extra term could so confuse anyone.</p>
  <p>
    The answer is that actual instances of the Four Term Fallacy are usually polymorphously
    fallacious, that is, they are also instances of <a href="equivoqu.html">Equivocation</a>.
    So, the fact that the argument has four terms is concealed by an equivocation on
    two of the terms in the argument, when one word <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguous">
      ambiguous</a>ly means two terms. When the equivocation is on the middle term,
    the resulting fallacy is <a href="ambimidd.html">Ambiguous Middle Term</a>.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Subfallacy:</strong> <a href="ambimidd.html">Ambiguous Middle Term</a></p>

    <a name="Analysis">Analysis of the Example:</a></h3>
  <p>
    This example seems to have a validating syllogistic form, but it actually has four
    terms instead of three. The four terms are: conservatives, Republicans, Democrats,
    and democrats. The word "democrat" has two meanings when capitalized and uncapitalized:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A member of the <strong>D</strong>emocratic Party, as opposed to a member of the
      Republican Party. A party member may be called a "big-D" <strong>D</strong>emocrat
      to distinguish them from the second sense:</li>
    <li>A supporter of democracy, as opposed to an anarchist, authoritarian, or totalitarian.
      These are referred to as "small-d" <strong>d</strong>emocrats, to distinguish them
      from the first sense.</li></ol>
  <p>
    In order for the example to be a genuine categorical syllogism, the two occurrences
    of "democrat" would have to be two occurrences of the same term, that is, they would
    have to have the same meaning. When two occurrences of the same word have different
    meanings they are two distinct terms. The Example commits the Four Term Fallacy
    if the <a href="glossary.html#MajorTerm">major term</a> of the conclusion is meant
    in sense 2&#8213;namely, that no conservatives are small-d democrats&#8213;which
    is not true.</p>
