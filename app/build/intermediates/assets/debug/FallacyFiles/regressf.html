    <h3>
      Etymology:</h3>
    <p>
      To "regress" is to go back, or revert to an earlier or more primitive state. The
      statistical term "regression" seems to have been first used by Francis Galton, Charles
      Darwin's cousin, to refer to the phenomenon on which the regression fallacy is based.
      Galton noticed that the children of tall parents tended to themselves be tall, but
      not as tall as their parents. Galton called this "regression to mediocrity", but
      nowadays it is usually referred to as "regression to (or towards) the mean" (see
      the Exposition below).

        Example:</h3>
      <p>
        KUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad congratulated Malaysian
        shuttler Mohd Hafiz Hashim for his achievement but warned that he should not be
        "spoilt" with gifts like previous champions.
        <p>
          "Very good and congratulations, but now I would like to request everybody not to
          spoil him," he said when asked to comment on Hafiz's victory in the men's singles
          final of the All-England Badminton Championships on Sunday.
          <p>
            Dr Mahathir said people should remember what had happened to previous champions
            when they were spoilt with gifts of land, money and other items.
            <p>
              "I hope the states will not start giving acres of land and money in the millions,
              because they all seem not to be able to play badminton after that," he said after
              taking part in the last dry run and dress rehearsal for the 13th NAM Summit at the
              PWTC yesterday.</blockquote>

                    Exposition:</h3>
                  <p>
                    The Regression Fallacy is the result of a statistical phenomenon known as "regression
                    to the mean". The "mean" refers to the arithmetical average of some variable in
                    a population, that is, the "mean" is what we usually mean by "average". "Regression"
                    refers to the value of the variable tending to move closer to the mean, away from
                    extreme values. So, "regression to the mean" refers to the tendency of a variable
                    characteristic in a population to move away from the extreme values towards the
                    average value.
                    <p>
                      Consider a sample taken from a population. The value of the variable will be some
                      distance from the mean. For instance, we could take a sample of people&#151it could
                      be just one&#151measure their heights, and then determine the average height of
                      the sample. This value will be some distance away from the average height of the
                      entire population of people, though the distance might be zero.
                      <p>
                        Suppose, further, that we take a second sample of the population. If the value for
                        the first sample is an extreme one&#151that is, far away from the mean&#151then
                        it is likely that the value of the variable for the second sample will be closer
                        to average than the first one. The farther away from the mean the first sample was,
                        the more likely that the second will be closer to it. This is regression to the
                        mean.
                        <p>
                          For example, the children of tall parents tend to be tall themselves, but not as
                          tall as their parents. The fact that the children tend to be taller than average
                          is probably the result of genetics, but the fact that they tend not to be as tall
                          as their parents is the result of regression to the mean. The Regression Fallacy
                          occurs when one mistakes regression to the mean, which is a statistical phenomenon,
                          for a causal relationship. For example, if a tall father were to conclude that his
                          tall wife committed adultery because their children were shorter, he would be committing
                          the regression fallacy.

                            Exposure:</h3>
                          <p>
                            One of the most common occasions for the Regression Fallacy is illness. People are
                            most likely to seek treatment for an illness&#151especially experimental treatment&#151when
                            they are at their sickest, that is, their condition is an extreme one. They take
                            a remedy, and then get better due to regression to the mean, but they attribute
                            their regained health to the effect of the remedy. This is one reason why some people
                            will swear by such bizarre treatments as drinking urine, or psychic surgery.
                            <p>
                              "It worked for me", they say, when all they really know is that they took the remedy
                              and they got better. Due to regression to the mean, many people will get better
                              no matter what treatment they take, even none at all. Some will die, luckily for
                              the snake oil salesmen, since the dead won't be around to badmouth the snake oil
                              that they took before dying.
                              <p>
                                Regression to the mean is one reason why it is difficult to determine whether a
                                potential remedy is really effective; one cannot tell simply by taking it when ill.

                                  A reader makes the following objection to the Example:
                                  <blockquote>
                                    I noticed something I disagree with: you give, as an example, a tennis player who
                                    wins tournaments and then doesn't win. However, the "regression to the mean" occurs
                                    because one assumes that luck was involved in the first observation being so far
                                    away from the mean. This is, strictly speaking, true in all circumstances&#8213;but
                                    the proportion of luck to skill involved in winning a tennis championship, I suspect,
                                    is greatly tipped towards skill. Thus, I think it improper to suggest that what
                                    "caused" the tennis players to not win again was solely regression to the mean,
                                    when the Malaysian prime minister may, in fact, have been right in believing that
                                    the winners got spoiled&#8213;logically, nothing favors one explanation over the
                                    other.</blockquote>
                                  <p>
                                    For regression to the mean to occur it isn't necessary that a phenomenon be entirely,
                                    or even primarily, random. So, even though skill is the primary factor in winning
                                    tennis, as long as there is some degree of luck involved, regression to the mean
                                    may occur. The prime minister might be right about what is causing the champions'
                                    playing to deteriorate, but he gives no evidence that the regression is due to the
                                    players being spoiled, other than the fact that they regressed. That's what makes
                                    this an example of the fallacy: the fact that the prime minister concludes that
                                    the players are spoiled on no other evidence than the fact that their play got worse,
                                    which is to be expected due to regression to the mean.
                                    <p>
                                      This is not a claim about what "caused" the tennis players' subsequent losses, since
                                      regression to the mean is a statistical, not a causal, phenomenon. Regression to
                                      the mean was first described by Francis Galton who was recording the heights of
                                      parents and their children. As mentioned above in the Etymology, the children of
                                      tall parents tend to be tall, but shorter than their parents; similarly, the children
                                      of short parents tend to be short, but taller than their parents. Of course, height
                                      is not a purely random factor, otherwise there would be no tendency for the height
                                      of children to be similar to the height of their parents. Causally, height is partly
                                      inherited from our parents, but there is also an element of chance in it, otherwise
                                      the height of a child would be precisely predictable from the heights of the parents.
                                      It is this random element that leads to regression to the mean.
                                      <p>
                                        How could the prime minister have non<a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>ly
                                        reasoned that the tennis players were indeed spoiled? He could have done so by comparing
                                        a group of players who were lavished with gifts to one that was not: if the pampered
                                        group regressed worse than the unpampered, that would go some distance to showing
                                        that the gifts really were spoiling the players.
