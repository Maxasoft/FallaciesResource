    All of the parts of the object <strong>O</strong> have the property <strong>P</strong>.

    Therefore, <strong>O</strong> has the property <strong>P</strong>.

    (Where the property <strong>P</strong> is one which does not distribute from parts
    to a whole.)

      Example:</h3>
    <blockquote>
      Should we not assume that just as the eye, hand, the foot, and in general each part
      of the body clearly has its own proper function, so man too has some function over
      and above the function of his parts?</blockquote>

          Counter-Example:</h3>
        <p>
          The human body is made up of cells, which are invisible.
          <br />
          Therefore, the body is invisible.
          <h3>
            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            Some properties are such that, if every part of a whole has the property, then the
            whole will too&#151for example, visibility. However, not all properties are like
            this&#151for instance, invisibility. All visible objects are made up of atoms, which
            are too small to see. Let's call a property which distributes from all of the parts
            to the whole an "expansive" property, using Nelson Goodman's term. If <strong>P</strong>
            is an expansive property, then the <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>
            form above is <a href="glossary.html#Validating">validating</a>, by definition of
            what such a property is. However, if <strong>P</strong> is not expansive, then the
            argument form is non-validating, and any argument of that form commits the fallacy
            of Composition.

              <p>
                The function of an organ is definable in terms of what the organ does to help the
                whole organism to live, however, one cannot define a function for the organism as
                a whole in this way. For this reason, "function" is not expansive. If it were true
                that human beings as a whole have a function, this would be a very different notion
                of function than that of the function of a human organ. So, even in this case, Aristotle's
                argument would commit a fallacy, though a different one, namely, <a href="equivoqu.html">
                  Equivocation</a>.
