  <blockquote>
    Probably the greatest American speech of our century was Gen. Douglas MacArthur's
    address to Congress on his return from Korea. Search all others, read this masterpiece,
    and you will recall what I mean. Many men are full of good language&#133. But a
    truly great speech requires not only superb language but great wisdom and great
    truth at a great moment from the heart of a great man&#133.
    <p>
      Gen. MacArthur wrote this speech flying in the "Bataan" from San Francisco to Washington&#133and
      in longhand&#133. He could compose it because he understood it. He spoke the truth
      because he knew it&#133. This speaker's great calling was liberty. Events full of
      terror and sorrow were at hand. Here was the needed reminder to his countrymen that
      the people who were in this war all the way were our men who ennoble the high, sharp
      Korean walls and live on Heartbreak Ridge every day. And die.
      <p>
        Here was prophecy as revealing as a beacon light&#133. Here was hope: the dedication
        that we will live in a world where those of us who are Americans can be proud&#133.
        Here was history tolling like an old and important bell: the mighty warning that
        mighty America, once having entered this major war, must not let it end in impasse&#133.
        <p>
    It was all spoken in less than 30 minutes and in 3074 words.</blockquote>

        Exposition:</h3>
      <p>
        A word or phrase is "loaded" when it has a secondary, evaluative meaning in addition
        to its primary, descriptive meaning. When language is "loaded", it is loaded with
        its evaluative meaning. A loaded word is like a loaded gun, and its evaluative meaning
        is the bullet.

          <caption>
            Examples</caption>
          <tr align="left">
            <th>
              Unloaded
            </th>
            <th>
              Loaded
            </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              Plant
            </td>
            <td>
              Weed
            </td>

          <tr>

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          While few words have <em>no</em> evaluative overtones, "plant" is a primarily descriptive
          term. "Weed", in contrast, has essentially the same descriptive meaning as "plant",
          but a negative evaluative meaning, as well. A weed is a plant of which we disapprove.
          <p>
            Loaded language is not inherently <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>,
            otherwise most poetry would commit this fallacy. However, it is often a logical
            <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap">boobytrap</a>, which may cause one to leap to
            an unwarranted evaluative <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">conclusion</a>. The
            fallacy is committed either when an arguer attempts to use loaded words in place
            of an <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>, or when an arguee makes an
            evaluation based on the colorful language in which an argument is clothed, rather
            than on the merits of the argument itself.
            <p>
              Loaded language is a <a href="glossary.html#Subfallacy">subfallacy</a> of Begging
              the Question, because to use loaded language fallaciously is to assume an evaluation
              that has not been proved, thereby failing to fulfill the burden of proof. For this
              reason, Jeremy Bentham dubbed this fallacy "Question-Begging Epithets".

                <a name="Analysis">Analysis of the Example:</a></h3>
              <p>
                This is an example of how a passage can consist of loaded language and little else.
                In reading this, we learn a lot of trivia about MacArthur's speech: that it was
                written in longhand on the plane "Bataan" flying from San Francisco to New York,
                that it was 3074 words long, and that it took less than 30 minutes to deliver. However,
                none of these facts has any bearing on whether that speech is "[p]robably the greatest
                American speech of our [20th] century". Instead, we get a lot of evaluative and
                loaded language, but nothing to back up the evaluation. Among the loaded words used
                in describing the speech are:
                <ul>
                  <li>"prophecy": The literal meaning of "prophecy" is "prediction", but the word is
                    associated with religion and thus suggests a religious significance to the speech,
                    as if MacArthur were a Biblical prophet.
                    <li>"history": MacArthur's speech is certainly of historical significance, but that
                      does not mean that the speech itself is a great one.
                      <li>"mighty": The literal meaning is simply "powerful" or "forceful", but "mighty"
                        is used rhetorically to suggest <em>good</em>
                  or benevolent power.</ul>
