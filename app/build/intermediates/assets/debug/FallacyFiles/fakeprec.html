    Quote&#8230;</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Implausibly precise statistics&#133are often bogus. Consider a precise number that
    is well known to generations of parents and doctors: the normal human body temperature
    of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Recent investigations involving millions of measurements
    have revealed that this number is wrong; normal human body temperature is actually
    98.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The fault, however, lies not with Dr. Wunderlich's original
    measurements&#151they were averaged and sensibly rounded to the nearest degree:
    37 degrees Celsius. When this temperature was converted to Fahrenheit, however,
    the rounding was forgotten, and 98.6 was taken to be accurate to the nearest tenth
    of a degree. Had the original interval between 36.5 degrees Celsius and 37.5 degrees
    Celsius been translated, the equivalent Fahrenheit temperatures would have ranged
    from 97.7 degrees to 99.5 degrees.</blockquote>

    Sometimes [a] big ado is made about a difference that is mathematically real and
    demonstrable but so tiny as to have no importance. &#133 A case in point is the
    hullabaloo over practically nothing that was raised so effectively, and so profitably,
    by the Old Gold cigarette people.
    <p>
      It started innocently with the editor of the <cite>Reader's Digest</cite>, who smokes
      cigarettes but takes a dim view of them all the same. His magazine went to work
      and had a battery of laboratory folk analyze the smoke from several brands of cigarettes.
      The magazine published the results, giving the nicotine and whatnot content of the
      smoke by brands. The conclusion stated by the magazine and borne out in its detailed
      figures was that all the brands were virtually identical and that it didn't make
      any difference which one you smoked. &#133</p>

      But somebody spotted something. In the lists of almost identical amounts of poisons,
      one cigarette had to be at the bottom, and the one was Old Gold. &#133[B]ig advertisements
      appeared in newspapers at once in the biggest type at hand. The headlines and the
      copy simply said that of all cigarettes tested by this great national magazine Old
      Gold had the least of these undesirable things in its smoke.</p>

    This fallacy occurs when an <a href="glossary.html#Argument" title="A unit of reasoning.">
      argument</a> treats information as more precise than it really is. This happens
    when imprecise information contained in the <a href="glossary.html#Premiss" title="The propositions in an argument that are intended to logically support the conclusion.">
      premisses</a> must be taken as precise in order to adequately support the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion"
        title="The proposition in an argument supposedly supported by the premisses.">conclusion</a>.</p>
  <p>
    One common effect of overly-precise numbers is that they impress some people as
    scientific. Many people are intimidated by math, and it is easy to awe them with
    meaningless numbers. Pseudoscientists use overprecision to create a bogus impression
    of science, whereas genuine scientists avoid overstating the precision of their
    results. So, overly precise numbers are not a mark of science, but of <em>pseudo</em>science.
    They should really lend <em>less</em>, not <em>more</em>, credibility to claims.</p>
  <h3>
    Exposure:</h3>
  <p>
    During every election, there are news stories claiming that one candidate is ahead
    of another based upon poll results. However, in the small print of most polls you
    will notice that the polling numbers have a margin of error of plus-or-minus three
    percentage points. This means that the poll results are really a range of possible
    percentages. Suppose, for instance, that the following is the result of the most
    recent poll:</p>
  <table cellpadding="10" align="center">
    <tr>
      <td>
        Candidate D: 44%
      </td>
      <td>
        Candidate R: 41%
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    It looks as if Candidate <strong>D</strong> is ahead of Candidate <strong>R</strong>,
    but the range of percentages is actually:</p>
  <table cellpadding="10" align="center">
    <tr>
      <td>
        Candidate D: 41-47%
      </td>
      <td>
        Candidate R: 38-44%
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>
    In other words, because these ranges overlap, Candidate <strong>R</strong> might
    actually be ahead of Candidate <strong>D</strong>, 44% to 41%. For this reason,
    when evaluating poll results, it's important to take into consideration the margin
    of error: most polls are imprecise enough that differences of a few percentage points
    are meaningless.</p>

    Q&A:</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Q:</strong> I think I experience a version of this fallacy in the readings
    of GPS instruments. Without a lot of very complex measurements and translations
    the GPS signal is (for me as non-military user) never better than, say, 8 to 15
    meters accurate. However, usually my GPS instrument will give me a position in millimeters
    or better. Is this a form of fake precision or is it just a matter of significant
    numbers?&#8213;Eric Dullaart</p>
  <p>
    <strong>A:</strong> This is an example of what I call a <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap"
      title="A nonfallacy that may cause someone to commit a fallacy.">logical boobytrap</a>,
    which is not itself a fallacy&#8213;since it's not even an argument&#8213;but which
    could cause someone to commit one. Luckily, you are not likely to do so, since you
    know about the instrument's accuracy from experience. However, someone who did not
    know that the instrument was only accurate at the level of meters, and certainly
    not to the millimeter, might be misled by it.</p>

    <a name="Analysis">Analysis of the Example:</a></h3>
  <p>
    Here is some historical background:</p>
  <img src="http://fallacyfiles.org/OldGold.jpg" border="0" alt="Not a Cough in a Carload">
  <blockquote>
    In&#8230;<em>P. Lorillard Co. v. FTC</em>, the company was charged by the FTC with
    making a distorted use of a <cite>Reader's Digest</cite> article that discussed
    the harmful effects of various brands of cigarettes. A laboratory had concluded
    that no particular brand of cigarettes was substantially more harmful than any other.
    A table of variations in brand characteristics was inserted in the article to show
    the insignificance of the differences that existed in the tar and nicotine content
    of the smoke produced by the various brands. The table indicated that Old Golds
    had less nicotine and tars, although the difference was so small as to be insignificant.
    Lorillard launched a national advertising campaign stressing that the <cite>Reader's
      Digest</cite> test proved that its brand was "lowest in nicotine and tars," and
    defended its advertising before the FTC on the ground that it had truthfully reported
    what had been stated in the article. In a 1950 decision, the Fourth Circuit Court
    of Appeals, upholding the commission's cease-and-desist order, declared that Lorillard's
    advertising violated the FTC Act because, by printing only a small part of the article,
    it created an entirely false and misleading impression. "To tell less than the whole
    truth is a well-known method of deception," the court ruled.</blockquote>
  <p>
    In order for the fact that Old Gold cigarettes have the lowest tar and nicotine
    of the tested brands to count as a good reason to smoke them instead of the others,
    it is necessary that the difference between Old Gold and the other cigarettes be
    significant. However, this is not the case, so the argument contained in the Old
    Gold ads committed the fallacy.</p>
