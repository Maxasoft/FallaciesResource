          Example:</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <em>Have the various fossil candidates for a place in our human ancestry stood the
            test of time?</em>
          <p>
            <strong>Answer:</strong> One by one, various fossil man finds have flashed across
            the front pages of the newspapers and been the subject of many scientific studies
            and reports, only to be at last either discredited or just forgotten, replaced by
            newer finds which also eventually fade away. In 1981 British scientist John Reader
            commented on this Hollywood character of some of our former alleged ancestors:
            <blockquote>
              "Not many (if any) [fossil hominids] have held the stage for long; by now laymen
              could be forgiven for regarding each new arrival as no less ephemeral than the weather
              forecast.&#133"</blockquote>

              Exposition:</h3>
            <p>
              To quote out of context is to remove a passage from its surrounding matter in such
              a way as to distort its meaning. The context in which a passage occurs always contributes
              to its meaning, and the shorter the passage the larger the contribution. For this
              reason, the quoter must always be careful to quote enough of the context not to
              misrepresent the meaning of the quote. Of course, in some sense, all quotation is
              out of context, but by a "<a href="glossary.html#Contextomy">contextomy</a>", I
              refer only to those quotes whose meaning is changed by a loss of context. The <em>
                fallacy</em> of Quoting Out of Context is committed when a contextomy is offered
              as evidence in an <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>. Such <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">
                fallacious</a> quoting can take two distinct forms:
              <ol>
                <li><a href="strawman.html"><strong>Straw Man</strong></a>: This form is especially
                  common in political debates, when an opponent is quoted out of context in order
                  to misrepresent the opponent's position, thus making it easier to refute. Frequently,
                  the loss of context makes the opponent sound simplistic or extreme.
                  <li><a href="authorit.html"><strong>Appeal to Authority</strong></a>: Naturally enough,
                    arguments from authority often quote the authority as a <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">
                      premiss</a>. However, it is possible to quote even legitimate authorities
                out of context so as to misrepresent the expert's opinion, which is a form of misleading
                appeal to authority.</ol>

                    <a name="Context1">Context of Quote:</a></h3>
                  <p>
                    Reader John Congdon writes about the Jesse Jackson quote:
                    <blockquote>
                      The problem is that Rev. Jackson was himself quoting Dr. Donald A. Carson, professor
                      of New Testament at the Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and the author of several
                      books, including (interestingly enough) one entitled Exegetical Fallacies.
                      <p>
                        The full quote, which Dr. Carson ascribes to his father, a Canadian minister, was
                        "A text without a context is a pretext for a proof text."
                        <p>
                          A "proof text" was originally a neutral term for the scriptural text that proved
                          (or was seen to prove) a particular doctrine. However, the overuse and even abuse
                          of proof texts (i.e., Quoting Out of Context as an Appeal to Authority) to defend
                          practically any position eventually led to "proof text" taking on a mainly negative&#8213;sometimes
                          even pejorative&#8213;connotation (Guilt by Association, anyone?).
                          <iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=thefallacyfil-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0801020867&fc1=006699&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=006666&bc1=ffffff&bg1=ffffff&npa=1&f=ifr"
                            style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"
                            frameborder="0" align="right"></iframe>
                          <p>
                            So, the original quote makes your point even more strongly: a contextomy used as
                            an appeal to authority is usually misleading. Of course, a false premiss does not
                            mean that the conclusion is <em>ipso facto</em> false. We need not commit the Fallacy
                            Fallacy.
                            <p>
                      Of course, the irony of an incomplete quote in the "Quoting Out of Context" article
                      is itself pretty funny.</blockquote>

                          Analysis:</h3>
                        <p>
                          Kofahl quotes Reader as evidence of his claim that "fossil hominids" are discredited,
                          but Reader's previous sentence makes it clear that he is saying only that it is
                          the title to "oldest evidence of mankind's existence" that is ephemeral. In other
                          words, still older evidence is discovered with sufficient frequency to make the
                          title of "oldest" short-lived. This is no evidence at all supporting Kofahl's contention,
                          in fact it is contrary evidence. By omitting the first sentence, the impression
                          is created that Reader is talking about <em>all</em> "fossil hominids", instead
                          of just the oldest ones. This false impression is reinforced by Kofahl's misleading
                          editorial insertion in brackets of the phrase "fossil hominids".
