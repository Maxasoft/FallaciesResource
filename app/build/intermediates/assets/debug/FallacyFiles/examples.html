    Stalking the Wild Fallacy</h1>
  <p>
    A "wild" fallacy example is not one that is unusually weird, rather it is one that
    is found in the "wild", in the natural habitat of argumentation. In contrast, a
    "tame" example is one created specifically to be an example of a fallacy, such as
    many of those found in textbooks.
    <p>
      This file contains examples of logical fallacies from the written media: books,
      newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and fundraising letters. I have included enough
      context so that the arguer's intention is not misrepresented, but excluded information
      irrelevant to the specific <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>.
      <p>
        Some points to keep in mind:
        <ul>
          <li>The level of difficulty of these examples varies from the obvious to the obscure.
            <li>Sometimes the fallacy is not committed by the writer, but by someone else, and
              only reported in the written passage.
              <li>Some of the examples are not full-fledged fallacies, but linguistic <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap">
                boobytraps</a> which might trick the reader into committing such a fallacy.
                <li>
          You can test your knowledge of the fallacies by reading each passage, identifying
          the fallacy committed, then clicking on "Fallacy" at the end, which will take you
          to the file for the specific fallacy committed.</ul>
        <p>
          If you have any good examples of logical fallacies, please <a href="mailto:fallacist@fallacyfiles.org">
            send them to me</a>! I prefer documented, as opposed to anecdotal, examples&#151that
          is, arguments drawn from some source that can be cited rather than from memory.

            <a name="Schaeffer">&#8230;[T]he acceptance of abortion does not end with the killing
              of unborn human life. It continues on to affect our attitude toward all aspects
              of human life. This is most obvious in how quickly, following the acceptance of
              abortion, comes the acceptance of infanticide&#8213;the killing of babies who after
              birth do not come up to someone's standard of life worthy to be lived&#8213;and
              then on to euthanasia of the aged. If human life can be taken before birth, there
              is no logical reason why human life cannot be taken after birth.

                            <a name="Oneill">The march was organised by the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, who
                              estimate that 20,000 people turned up. It kicked off with a rally outside the American
                              Embassy in Grosvenor Square to demand that the Bush administration ratify the Kyoto
                              Protocol. Here, the demonstrators followed in the footsteps of that other well-known
                              progressive Osama bin Laden (and numerous others, of course) who in a ‘Letter to
                              America’ in 2002 accused it of having ‘destroyed nature with your industrial waste
                              and gases more than any other nation in history, [yet] you refuse to sign the Kyoto
                              agreement so that you can secure the profit of your greedy companies and industries’.
                              This was almost the exact same argument made by most of the demonstrators, though
                              I’m pleased to report that there was no ‘Al-Qaeda against climate change’ contingent.

                                            that it has chosen not to make its cars safer for pedestrians because of uncertainties
                                            over a forthcoming European Pedestrian Safety Directive. "We are waiting to find
                                            out which direction the EU wants to go in," a spokesman says.
                                            <p>
                                              The directive will force car makers to meet minimum standards for pedestrian safety&#8230;.
                                              In Phase 1 of the directive, new models sold in the EU must meet preliminary standards
                                              from October 2005, and all new cars must meet the standards by 2012. &#8230;
                                              <p>
                                                Phase 2 imposes more demanding tests, which apply to new models from 2010, and to
                                                new cars from 2015. &#8230; EU-wide, Phase 2 is expected to prevent 854 deaths a
                                                year among pedestrians and cyclists, and 36,917 serious injuries.

                                                  their representative body, ACEA, to make the Phase 2 tests less stringent. &#8230;
                                                  ACEA's proposals have been calculated to lead to 443 additional deaths and 9,746
                                                  additional serious injuries every year, relative to the original proposals.
