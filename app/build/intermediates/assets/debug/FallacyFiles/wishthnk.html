    Example:</h3>
  <blockquote>
    I was attending a spiritualist message reading service. The guest speaker had each
    of us write our name and a question on a piece of paper and then fold the paper.
    An usher collected the folded messages in a basket which she then placed beside
    the speaker's lectern. The speaker, who had been blindfolded, would reach into the
    basket, pull out a folded message, and hold it to his forehead. After a dramatic
    pause he would call out someone's name. The named person would then stand and the
    speaker would provide an answer to the question. Presumably this answer was supplied
    by the spirits. &#133
    <p>
      &#133 On this occasion, however, the speaker was having obvious difficulties. He
      was getting along in years and his eyesight was not very good. &#133 So he pulled
      his blindfold away from his eyes with one hand while he blatantly opened the message
      with the other. After he read its contents, he refolded it, pulled his blindfold
      back in place, and continued with his routine.
      <p>
        I looked at the members of the audience to see how they would react to this obvious
        display of cheating. &#133 To my surprise, not one of them was looking at the speaker.
        Some were gazing at the ceiling, some were staring into their laps, and others had
        their eyes closed. The woman sitting next to me was one of those looking at the
        ceiling. I nudged her and pointed to the speaker at the moment he was opening a
        message. She looked at me instead. I whispered for her to look at the speaker. She
        turned and looked at the back of the room and then turned back to me. I kept urging
        her to look at the speaker. She leaned back and resumed staring at the ceiling.

        <p>
    This bizarre behavior by the audience both puzzled and amazed me. &#133 These people
    did not want to see the speaker cheating! They wanted to believe that he was providing
    them communications from their departed loved ones. &#133 They dealt with this conspicuous
    example of cheating by simply not looking. &#133</blockquote>

    <h3>
      Exposition:</h3>
    <p>
      Psychologically, "wishful thinking" is believing something because of a desire&#151"wish"&#151that
      it be true. As a logical fallacy, Wishful Thinking is an <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
        argument</a> whose <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a> expresses a desire
      for the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">conclusion</a> to be true.
      <p>
        Of course, this type of thinking seldom takes the explicit form of an argument from
        a premiss about one's belief to the conclusion that one's wish is true. Such bald
        wishful thinking would be patently <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>
        even to the wishful thinker. Rather, wishful thinking usually takes the form of
        a bias towards the belief in <strong>P</strong>, which leads to the overestimating
        of the weight of evidence in favor of <strong>P</strong>, as well as the underestimating
        of the weight against. As in the case of the <strong>Example</strong>, it can lead
        to ignoring the evidence against a cherished belief, which is a case of <a href="onesided.html">
          one-sidedness</a>.
        <h3>
          Exposure:</h3>
        <p>
          Wishful thinking has been practiced under such names as "positive thinking", "optimism",
          "visualization", and "faith". Under these names, it has had its distinguished defenders.
          Defenses of wishful thinking have taken one of the following forms:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Moral/Ethical Defenses:</strong> Religious faith has frequently been claimed
              to be either a virtue or a duty. To believe a dogma without evidence, or even despite
              counter-evidence, is sometimes regarded as more admirable than to believe on good
              evidence. Unfortunately, this doctrine itself must be taken on faith, as there is
              no evidence for it!
              <li><strong>Pragmatic/Prudential Defenses:</strong> A pragmatic or prudential defense
                of wishful thinking is based on the claim that one stands to gain from such belief,
                and that this is a sufficient reason to believe. William James' famous defense of
                "the will to believe"&#151that is, wishful thinking&#151is of this type. James argued
                that there can be pragmatic value in believing something by an act of will, when
                there is insufficient evidence to justify belief or disbelief. If there is pragmatic
                value in believing a truth, but no evidence for it, then the only way that one can
                gain that pragmatic value is by a "leap of faith".
                <p>
                  The thing to notice about the pragmatic/prudential defense is that it does not claim
                  that the statement believed on faith will actually be true, or is even likely to
                  be true. Rather the claim is that one can gain in some way by believing something
                  that may be false for all that. While this may well be true, it is neither a logical
                  nor epistemological defense of wishful thinking, unless&#151like James&#151one equates
                  pragmatic value with truth.
                  <p>
            Suppose I offer a prize of a million dollars to anyone who believes that pigs have
            wings. There is no doubt that, if you can only force yourself to do so, you stand
            to gain from believing this. However, the fact that you win a million dollars in
            no way tends to show that pigs have wings.</ol>
          <p>
            The trouble with both of these defenses is that they do not show that wishful thinking
            is ever <a href="glossary.html#Cogent">cogent</a>, instead they support the following
            types of argument:
            <ol>
              <li><strong>P</strong> is an article of faith.
                <br />
                Therefore, I ought, morally, to believe <strong>P</strong>.
                <p>
                  <li>I stand to gain from believing <strong>P</strong>.
                    <br />
                    Hence, I should, prudentially, believe <strong>P</strong>
              .</ol>
            <p>
              But from the conclusions of either of these arguments, it does not follow that <strong>
                P</strong> is true, or likely to be so. So, Wishful Thinking is still a fallacy,
              even if we accept that it is sometimes the virtuous or prudent thing to do.
