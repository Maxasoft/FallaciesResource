    Ambiguity</h1>
  <strong>Type:</strong> <a href="inforfal.html">Informal Fallacy</a>
  <h3>
    Example:</h3>
  <p>
    President Clinton should have been impeached only if he had sexual relations with
    Monica Lewinsky.
    <br />
    He did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky.
    <br />
    Therefore, he should not have been impeached.
    <h3>
      Exposition:</h3>
    <p>
      As a feature of language, ambiguity occurs when a word or phrase has more than one
      meaning. For instance, the word "note" can mean either:
      <ol>
        <li>A musical tone.
          <li>
        A short written record.</ol>
      <p>
        In fact, the <cite>Random House College Dictionary</cite> lists twenty meanings
        of "note", though one of these is archaic. Even the part of speech is <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguous">
          ambiguous</a>, since "note" can be either a noun or verb. This situation is not
        at all unusual, and "note" is not a particularly ambiguous word. Opening any dictionary
        at random will confirm that it is the rare word that is not ambiguous. In fact,
        ambiguity tends to increase with frequency of usage, and it is rarely-used technical
        terms that are unambiguous. For instance, "is" is highly ambiguous and has, as a
        result, caused much mischief in metaphysics, and even politics.
        <p>
          As a logical fallacy, Ambiguity occurs when linguistic <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguity">
            ambiguity</a> causes the form of an <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>
          to appear <a href="glossary.html#Validating">validating</a> when it is not.
          <h3>
            Exposure:</h3>
          <p>
            Because of the ubiquity of ambiguity in natural language, it is important to realize
            that its presence in an argument is not sufficient to render it <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">
              fallacious</a>, otherwise, <em>all</em> such arguments would be fallacious. Most
            ambiguity is logically harmless, a fallacy occurring only when ambiguity causes
            an argument's form to appear validating when it is not. Consider the <strong>Example</strong>:
            If the phrase "sexual relations" is being used univocally, then it has the following
            form:
            <p>
              <strong>p</strong> only if <strong>q</strong>.
              <br />
              Not-<strong>q</strong>.
              <br />
              Therefore, not-<strong>p</strong>.
              <p>
                This is, of course, a version of the validating form <a href="glossary.html#ModusTollens">
                  Modus Tollens</a>. However, if "sexual relations" has one meaning in the first
                <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a>, and a different meaning in the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
                  conclusion</a>, then it is used ambiguously, and the argument has the following
                non-validating form:
                <p>
                  <strong>p</strong> only if <strong>q</strong>.
                  <br />
                  Not-<strong>r</strong>.
                  <br />
                  Therefore, not-<strong>p</strong>.
                  <p>
                    Such an argument commits a Fallacy of Ambiguity (specifically, Equivocation), because
                    it may seem to have a validating form when the audience interprets the ambiguous
                    phrase univocally. Thus, arguments which commit the Fallacy of Ambiguity can seem
                    to be <a href="glossary.html#Valid">valid</a>.

                      While not always a fallacy, ambiguity is frequently misleading. For instance, in
                      the much publicized statement by President Clinton:
                      <blockquote>
                        I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.</blockquote>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Source:</strong> Howard Kurtz, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684857154/thefallacyfil-20"
                          target="_blank"><cite>Spin Cycle: Inside the Clinton Propaganda Machine</cite></a>
                        (Touchstone, 1998), p. 297.
                        <p>
                          This claim was testimony, rather than argument, so it cannot be fallacious. However,
                          it is now clear that it was intended to snare the listener into concluding, falsely,
                          that there was no sexual relationship between the President and Miss Lewinsky. The
                          ambiguity came from the phrase "sexual relations", which has a broad and narrow
                          meaning:
                          <ol>
                            <li>A sexual relationship
                              <li>
                            Sexual intercourse</ol>
                          <p>
                            As he later admitted, President Clinton had had "sexual relations" with Miss Lewinsky
                            in the broad sense (1), and he was denying it only in the narrow sense (2).

                            <p>
                              Unintentionally ambiguous statements are frequently sources of humor, especially
                              when one of the possible meanings is ludicrous. For example:
                              <blockquote>
                                <strong>Police blotter</strong>
                                <p>
                                Sent city police out at 11:38 a.m. to kick kids off the roof of a downtown furniture
                                store.</blockquote>
