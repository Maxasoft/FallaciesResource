    Improper Transposition</h1>

      Example:</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Tavis Smiley (interviewer):</strong> How are you going to respond to folks
      on the campaign trail when they ask what qualifies you to be the commander-in-chief
      given that you have not served in the country's military?
      <p>
        <strong>Al Sharpton (interviewee):</strong> I think that just because one served
        in the military does not make one a competent commander-in-chief.

            <em>Improper</em> transposition occurs when the <a href="glossary.html#Antecedent">
              antecedent</a> and <a href="glossary.html#Consequent">consequent</a> of the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
                conclusion</a> of a <a href="glossary.html#Transposition">transposition</a>
            are switched. In a proper transposition, the antecedent and consequent of the <a
              href="glossary.html#ConditionalProp">conditional</a> <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">
                premiss</a> are switched and <a href="glossary.html#Negation">negated</a>&#8213;see
            the Similar Validating Forms in the table above. In an <em>im</em>proper transposition,
            the antecedent and consequent are negated, but not switched&#8213;see the Forms
            and Examples in the table above. Proper transposition is a <a href="glossary.html#Validating">
              validating</a> form of <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>, but improper
            transposition is not&#8213;see the <a href="glossary.html#CounterExample">Counter-Example</a>
            above, which is an example of the fallacy with a true premiss and false conclusion.
            <h3>
              Exposure:</h3>
            <p>
              The forms of improper transposition are similar enough to those of true transposition
              to be confused with them, especially since transposition is a complex logical transformation
              of a conditional <a href="glossary.html#Statement">statement</a>. This fallacy bears
              the same type of similarity to <a href="denyante.html">Denying the Antecedent</a>
              as <a href="commcond.html">Commutation of Conditionals</a> bears to <a href="afthecon.html">
                Affirming the Consequent</a>. Like all of these conditional fallacies, it is most
              plausible when the <a href="glossary.html#Converse">converse</a> of the premiss
              is also true.
              <h4>
                <a name="Analysis">Analysis of the Example:</a></h4>
              <p>
                Smiley says that some people will raise the objection: "If ['given that'] someone
                has not served in the military then he is not qualified to be Commander-in-Chief".
                This is equivalent, by <em>proper</em> transposition, to: "If someone is qualified
                to be Commander-in-Chief then he has served in the military." Since Sharpton had
                not served in the military, this would imply that he is not qualified for the Presidency,
                by <a href="glossary.html#ModusTollens">Modus Tollens</a>.
                <p>
                  However, Sharpton says that he will respond to anyone who raises Smiley's objection
                  by denying: "If ['just because'] someone has served in the military then he is qualified
                  to be Commander-in-Chief". This is the <em>im</em>proper transposition of Smiley's
                  objection, and is not logically equivalent to it. To see this, notice that Smiley's
                  objection is at least plausible, for it says that military service is a <a href="glossary.html#NecessaryCond">
                    necessary condition</a> for being Commander-in-Chief. However, Sharpton denies
                  an easily refuted claim, namely, that military service is a <a href="glossary.html#SufficientCond">
                    sufficient condition</a> for being Commander-in-Chief. It isn't a sufficient condition
                  because there are other conditions required to fill the office of President.
                  <p>
                    Note that the negation in Sharpton's conditional has <a href="glossary.html#WideScope">
                      wide scope</a>, that is, over the entire conditional. Otherwise, the <a href="glossary.html#Scope">
                        scope</a> would be on the consequent of the conditional, producing the implausible
                    claim: "If someone has served in the military then he is not qualified to be Commander-in-Chief".
                    <p>
                      So, Sharpton did not answer the objection raised by Smiley, but pulled a logical
                      "bait and switch" by improperly transposing it into an easily refuted claim. The
                      two claims are similar enough that most people will not realize what Sharpton has
                      done, and it is even possible that Sharpton himself did not realize it.
