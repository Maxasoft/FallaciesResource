          Example:</h3>
        <blockquote>
          William Bennett&#8230;, leader&#8230; of the antirap campaign&#8230;, [has] had
          no trouble finding antipolice and antiwomen lyrics to quote in support of [his]
          claim that "nothing less is at stake than civilization" if rappers are not rendered
          silent. So odious are the lyrics, that rarely do politicians or journalists stop
          to ask what qualifies Bennett to lead a moralistic crusade on behalf of America's
          minority youth. Not only has he opposed funding for the nation's leader in quality
          children's programming (the Public Broadcasting Corporation), he has urged that
          "illegitimate" babies be taken from their mothers and put in orphanages.</blockquote>

                Exposition:</h3>
              <p>
                A debater commits the Ad Hominem Fallacy when he introduces irrelevant personal
                <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a>es about his opponent. Such red herrings
                may successfully distract the opponent or the audience from the topic of the debate.
                <h3>
                  Exposure:</h3>
                <p>
                  Ad Hominem is the most familiar of informal fallacies, and&#151with the possible
                  exception of Undistributed Middle&#151the most familiar logical fallacy of them
                  all. It is also one of the most used and abused of fallacies, and both justified
                  and unjustified accusations of Ad Hominem abound in any debate. It is a frequently
                  misidentified fallacy, for many people seem to think that any personal criticism,
                  attack, or insult counts as an <em>ad hominem</em> fallacy. Moreover, in some contexts
                  the phrase "ad hominem" may refer to an ethical lapse, rather than a logical mistake,
                  as it may be a violation of debate etiquette to engage in personalities. So, in
                  addition to ignorance, there is also the possibility of equivocation on the meaning
                  of "ad hominem".
                  <p>
                    For instance, the charge of "ad hominem" is often raised during American political
                    campaigns, but is seldom logically warranted. We vote for, elect, and are governed
                    by politicians, not platforms; in fact, political platforms are primarily symbolic
                    and seldom enacted. So, personal criticisms are logically relevant to deciding who
                    to vote for. Of course, such criticisms may be logically relevant but factually
                    mistaken, or wrong in some other non-logical way.
                    <p>
                      Finally, the phrase "ad hominem argument" is occasionally used to refer to a very
                      different type of <a href="glossary.html#Argument" title="A unit of reasoning.">argument</a>,
                      namely, one that uses premisses accepted by the opposition to argue for a position.
                      In other words, if you are trying to convince someone of something, using premisses
                      that the person accepts&#151whether or not you believe them yourself. This is not
                      necessarily a <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious" title="Committing a logical fallacy.">
                        fallacious</a> argument, and is often rhetorically effective.

                        <li><strong><a name="Abusive">Abusive</a>:</strong> An Abusive Ad Hominem occurs when
                          an attack on the character or other irrelevant personal qualities of the opposition&#151such
                          as appearance&#151is offered as evidence against their position. Such attacks are
                          often effective distractions ("red herrings"), because the opponents feel it necessary
                          to defend themselves, thus being distracted from the topic of the debate.
                          <li><strong><a name="Circumstantial">Circumstantial</a>:</strong> A Circumstantial
                            Ad Hominem is one in which some irrelevant personal circumstance surrounding the
                            opposition is offered as evidence against their position. This fallacy is often
                            introduced by phrases such as: "Of course, that's what you'd expect them to say."
                            The fallacy claims that the only reason why they argue as they do is because of
                            personal circumstances, such as standing to gain from the argument's acceptance.
                            <p>
                              This form of the fallacy needs to be distinguished from criticisms directed at testimony,
                              which are not fallacious, since pointing out that someone stands to gain from testifying
                              a certain way would tend to cast doubt upon that testimony. For instance, when a
                              celebrity endorses a product, it is usually in return for money, which lowers the
                              evidentiary value of such an endorsement&#151often to nothing! In contrast, the
                              fact that an arguer may gain in some way from an argument's acceptance does not
                              affect the evidentiary value of the argument, for arguments can and do stand or
                              fall on their own merits.

                        <li><strong>Q:</strong> Despite taking an introduction to logic course last semester,
                          I still cannot differentiate between when it's permissible to attack someone's credibility
                          and when it's considered an ad hominem. Could you shed some light on this for me?&#8213;Paul
                          Margiotis
                          <p>
                            <strong>A:</strong> The main thing to keep in mind is the distinction between argumentation
                            and testimony. The whole point of logic is to develop techniques for evaluating
                            the <a href="glossary.html#Cogency">cogency</a> of arguments independently of the
                            arguer's identity. So, ask the question: is the person being criticized arguing
                            or testifying? Are reasons being presented, or must we take the person's word for
                            something? If the person is arguing, the <a href="glossary.html#Argument" title="A unit of reasoning.">
                              argument</a> should be evaluated on its own merits; if testifying, then credibility
                            is important.
                            <li><strong>Q:</strong> I am having a disagreement over the proper usage of the term
                              "ad hominem". My opponent claims that any personal attack during a debate that is
                              not an attempt to discredit the opponent, but just rude, is an "ad hominem attack",
                              if not necessarily an "ad hominem argument". I believe this is a false distinction,
                              partially due to a misreading of your paragraph on misidentification of ad hominem
                              arguments. I argue that the personal insult is not an ad hominem because it is not
                              an attempt to discredit the argument of the opponent, but is just rudeness. Can
                              you please help?&#8213;Jon
                              <p>
                                <strong>A:</strong>
                        I don't think there's a precise definition of "ad hominem attack", but on the rare
                        occasions when I've used the phrase it was as a synonym of "personal attack". So,
                        an ad hominem attack is not necessarily an argument, let alone an instance of the
                        fallacy. A lawyer attacking the credibility of a witness in a trial would be engaging
                        in an "ad hominem attack", but not necessarily a fallacious one. However, every
                        ad hominem argument is an ad hominem attack. Thus, ad hominem attack is a more general
                        concept than ad hominem argument.</ul>

                      <p>
                        This is an Ad Hominem of the circumstantial variety. Glassner suggests that Bennett
                        is somehow unqualified to criticize rap music because of positions he allegedly
                        took on other issues. However wrong Bennett may have been on other issues, such
                        as the funding of public television or illegitimacy, that does not mean that his
                        criticisms of rap were mistaken.
