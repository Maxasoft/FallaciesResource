        Example:</h3>
      <blockquote>
        Students stormed the stage at Columbia University's Roone auditorium yesterday,
        knocking over chairs and tables and attacking Jim Gilchrist, the founder of the
        Minutemen, a group that patrols the border between America and Mexico. Mr. Gilchrist
        and Marvin Stewart, another member of his group, were in the process of giving a
        speech at the invitation of the Columbia College Republicans. They were escorted
        off the stage unharmed and exited the auditorium by a back door. &#8230; The student
        protesters&#8230;booed and shouted the speakers down throughout. They interrupted
        Mr. Stewart&#8230;. A student's demand that Mr. Stewart speak in Spanish elicited
        thundering applause and brought the protesters to their feet. The protesters remained
        standing, turned their backs on Mr. Stewart for the remainder of his remarks, and
        drowned him out by chanting, "Wrap it up, wrap it up!" &#8230; On campus, the Republicans'
        flyers advertising the event were defaced and torn down.</blockquote>

            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            The name "argumentum ad baculum" alludes to the use of a stick, or club&#8213;a
            "baculum" was a walking-stick or staff&#8213;to beat someone. As a logical fallacy,
            "ad baculum" or "appeal to force" applies to the use of force and, by extension,
            the use of threats of force to "win" a debate.
            <p>
              There are two types of logical error that may be involved in appeals to force:
              <ol>
                <li>Some appeals to force may be appeals to the consequences of a belief. What sets
                  the appeal to force apart from other appeals to consequences is that the bad consequences
                  appealed to&#8213;that is, the use of force&#8213;will be caused by the arguer.
                  Attempts to change people's minds by threats of punishment are appeals to consequences,
                  since the bad consequences appealed to are not consequences of what is believed,
                  but of the belief itself. As such, they are irrelevant to the <a href="glossary.html#TruthValue">
                    truth-value</a> of the belief.
                  <p>
                    However, because it is impossible to read a person's mind, the attempt to use force
                    or threats to change minds is usually ineffective. Instead, threats are more commonly
                    reasons to act, and as such can be good reasons to do so if the threat is plausible.
                    People are sometimes intimidated into pretending to believe things that they don't,
                    but this is not coming to believe something because of the fear of force. So, appeals
                    to force which are appeals to consequence may fail one criterion of a logical fallacy,
                    namely, that it be a common type of bad argument.
                    <li>When force or the threat of force is used to suppress the arguments of one side
                      in a debate, that is a type of one-sidedness. Governments are always tempted to
                      use police powers to prevent criticism of their policies, and totalitarian governments
                      are frequently successful in doing so. Extremists use threats or actual violence
                      to silence those who argue against them. Audience members "shout down" a debater
                      whom they disagree with in order to prevent a case from being heard. This is, unfortunately,
                      common enough to qualify as a logical fallacy.
                      <p>
                        However, force or the threat of it is not an argument, which means that appealing
                        to force is not a <em>logical</em> fallacy. Since hitting someone over the head
                        with a stick is not an argument at all, <a href="glossary.html#Afortiori"><em>a fortiori</em></a>
                        it is not a <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious"><em>fallacious</em></a> one. However,
                        withholding relevant information can lead people into drawing false <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
                          conclusion</a>
                s.</ol>
              <p>
                For these reasons, calling the appeal to force a "logical fallacy" is misleading.
                More accurately, it is a logical <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap">boobytrap</a>,
                that is, a way of tricking someone else into reasoning incorrectly.
