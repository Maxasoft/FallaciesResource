        Negating a <a href="glossary.html#Conjunction" title="A proposition of the 'both...and...' form.">
          conjunction</a>&#151"not both", which is sometimes abbreviated as "nand"&#151means
        that at least one of the <a href="glossary.html#Conjunct" title="One of the component propositions of a conjunction.">
          conjunct</a>s is false, but it leaves open the possibility that <em>both</em>
        conjuncts are false. So, if we know that one of the conjuncts is true, we may <a
          href="glossary.html#Valid" title="Necessarily preserving truth, that is, the truth of the premisses necessitate the truth of the conclusion.">
          valid</a>ly infer that the other is false (by Conjunctive Argument, see Similar
        Validating Forms above). In contrast, if we know that one of the conjuncts is false,
        we cannot validly infer from that information alone that the other is true, since
        it may be false as well (Denying a Conjunct).
        <p>
          Presumably, it is the similarity between these two <a href="glossary.html#Argument"
            title="A unit of reasoning.">argument</a> forms&#8213;Conjunctive Argument and
          Denying a Conjunct&#8213;that is the psychological source of the fallacy. In other
          words, people confuse the fallacious form&#8213;Denying a Conjunct&#8213;with the
          <a href="glossary.html#Validating" title="Having only valid instances.">validating</a>
          form&#8213;Conjunctive Argument.
          <p>
            Moreover, Denying a Conjunct is likely to seem more plausible when we have independent
            reasons for thinking that at least one of the two conjuncts is true. Suppose that
            we add to Denying a Conjunct the further <a href="glossary.html#Disjunctive" title="Of the 'either...or...' form.">
              disjunctive</a> <a href="glossary.html#Premiss" title="A proposition in an argument that supposedly supports the conclusion.">
                premiss</a>:
            <p>
              Either <strong>p</strong> or <strong>q</strong>.
              <p>
                The resulting argument form is <a href="glossary.html#Validating" title="Having only valid instances.">
                  validating</a>. So, when it is reasonable to suppose that the disjunctive premiss
                has been <a href="glossary.html#Suppressed" title="Unexpressed.">suppressed</a>,
                the argument will be a valid <a href="glossary.html#Enthymeme" title="An argument with a suppressed proposition.">

                  The confusing alias "The Fallacy of the Disjunctive Syllogism" comes from W. L.
                  Reese's <cite>Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion</cite>. Here is the complete
                  entry:
                  <blockquote>
                    The Fallacy of the Disjunctive Syllogism: affirming and denying. The disjunctive
                    syllogism utilizes a stronger sense of either-or, that of mutual exclusion. When
                    the intention of the premises is to assert: Not both A and B, it is clear that one
                    cannot argue "Not A. Therefore, B." &#8230; For example, on the dinner menu one
                    may have a choice of green beans or cauliflower. It would not do to argue:
                    <p>
                      "Either green beans or cauliflower.
                      <br />
                      I do not care for green beans.
                      <br />
                    Therefore, I must take cauliflower."</blockquote>
                  <p>
                    <a href="glossary.html#DisjSyll">Disjunctive Syllogism</a> (D.S.) is the name usually
                    given to a validating form of argument, so to call it a "fallacy" is puzzling, though
                    perhaps it might be used as the name of a fallacious form of argument similar to
                    D.S. The example at the end of the entry is actually an instance of D.S. and, therefore,
                    valid. Of course, there does seem to be something wrong with the argument, but this
                    is because Reese has misrepresented its form. Specifically, the first premiss is
                    not fully expressed, since neither "green beans" nor "cauliflower" are <a href="glossary.html#Proposition"
                      title="A sentence that is either true or false.">propositions</a>. The argument
                    is more accurately analyzed as follows:
                    <p>
                      "I may take either green beans or cauliflower (but not both).
                      <br />
                      I do not care for green beans.
                      <br />
                      Therefore, I may take cauliflower."</blockquote>
                      <p>
                        If the premisses are true, then the conclusion must be true, so the argument is
                        valid. However, the fact that you <em>may</em> select the cauliflower does not obligate
                        you to do so, and you may choose neither.
                        <p>
                          Logicians usually distinguish two senses of "either-or":
                          <ol>
                            <li><strong>Inclusive</strong>: The logically weaker sense in which at least one disjunct
                              is true, and both may be true. Reese calls this sense: "alternation".
                              <li><strong>Exclusive</strong>: The logically stronger sense in which exactly
                            one disjunct is true, and both cannot be true. Reese calls this sense: "disjunction".</ol>
                          <p>
                            However, D.S. is a validating form of argument for both senses.
                            <p>
                              The exclusive sense of "either p or q" is equivalent to "either p or q but not both
                              p and q", where "either&#8230;or" is inclusive. Reese seems to have mistaken the
                              exclusive form of "either&#8230;or" for "not both&#8230;and", by somehow dropping
                              the "either&#8230;or". For these reasons, the alias should be avoided.
