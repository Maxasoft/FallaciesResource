    Division</h1>
  <strong>Type:</strong> <a href="inforfal.html">Informal Fallacy</a>
  <h3>
    Form:</h3>
  <p>
    The object <strong>O</strong> has the property <strong>P</strong>.
    <br />
    Therefore, all of the parts of <strong>O</strong> have the property <strong>P</strong>.
    <br />
    (Where the property <strong>P</strong> is one which does not distribute from a whole
    to its parts.)
    <h3>
      Example:</h3>
    <p>
      The universe has existed for fifteen billion years.
      <br />
      The universe is made out of molecules.
      <br />
      Therefore, each of the molecules in the universe has existed for fifteen billion
      years.
      <h3>
        Counter-Example:</h3>
      <p>
        People are made out of atoms.
        <br />
        People are visible.
        <br />
        Therefore, atoms are visible.
        <h3>
          Exposition:</h3>
        <p>
          Some properties are such that, if a whole object has the property, then all of its
          parts will, too&#151for example, invisibility. However, not all properties are like
          this&#151for instance, visibility. Let's call a property which distributes from
          a whole object to each of its parts a "dissective" property, using Nelson Goodman's
          term. If <strong>P</strong> is a dissective property, then the <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
            argument</a> form above is <a href="glossary.html#Validating">validating</a>,
          by definition of what such a property is. However, if <strong>P</strong> is not
          dissective, then the argument form is non-validating, and any argument of that form
          commits the fallacy of Division.
