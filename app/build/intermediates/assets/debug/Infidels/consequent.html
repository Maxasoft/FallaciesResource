  <p>This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true." To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the <a href="ConstructingALogicalArgument.html#truthtable">truth table for implication</a> given earlier. Here's an example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"If the universe had been created by a supernatural being, we would see order and organization everywhere. And we do see order, not randomness--so it's clear that the universe had a creator."</p>

  <p>This is the converse of <a href="antecedent.html">Denial of the Antecedent</a>.</p>
