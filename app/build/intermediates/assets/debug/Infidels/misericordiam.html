  <h4><a id="misericordiam" name="misericordiam">Argumentum ad misericordiam</a> (Appeal to pity; Special pleading)</h4>

  <p>This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading. The fallacy is committed when someone appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe! Please don't find me guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan."</p>
