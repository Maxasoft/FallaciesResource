  <h4><a id="hominem" name="hominem">Argumentum ad hominem</a> (Abusive: attacking the person)</h4>

  <p>Argumentum ad hominem literally means "argument directed at the man"; there are two varieties.</p>

  <p>The first is the abusive form. If you refuse to accept a statement, and justify your refusal by criticizing the person who made the statement, then you are guilty of abusive argumentum ad hominem. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"You claim that atheists can be moral--yet I happen to know that you abandoned your wife and children."</p>

  <p>This is a fallacy because the truth of an assertion doesn't depend on the virtues of the person asserting it. A less blatant argumentum ad hominem is to reject a proposition based on the fact that it was also asserted by some other easily criticized person. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Therefore we should close down the church? Hitler and Stalin would have agreed with you."</p>

  <p>A second form of argumentum ad hominem is to try and persuade someone to accept a statement you make, by referring to that person's particular circumstances. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Therefore it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food. I hope you won't argue otherwise, given that you're quite happy to wear leather shoes."</p>

  <p>This is known as circumstantial argumentum ad hominem. The fallacy can also be used as an excuse to reject a particular conclusion. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Of course you'd argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. You're white."</p>

  <p>This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when you allege that someone is rationalizing a conclusion for selfish reasons, is also known as "poisoning the well."</p>

  <p>It's not always invalid to refer to the circumstances of an individual who is making a claim. If someone is a known perjurer or liar, that fact will reduce their credibility as a witness. It won't, however, prove that their testimony is false in this case. It also won't alter the soundness of any logical arguments they may make.</p>
