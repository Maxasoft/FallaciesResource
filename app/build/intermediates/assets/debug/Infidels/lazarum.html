  <h4><a id="lazarum" name="lazarum">Argumentum ad lazarum</a></h4>

  <p>The fallacy of assuming that someone poor is sounder or more virtuous than someone who's wealthier. This fallacy is the opposite of the <a href="crumenam.html">Argumentum ad Crumenam</a>. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Monks are more likely to possess insight into the meaning of life, as they have given up the distractions of wealth."</p>
