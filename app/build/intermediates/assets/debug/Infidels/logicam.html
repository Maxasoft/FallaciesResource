  <h4><a id="logicam" name="logicam">Argumentum ad logicam</a></h4>

  <p>This is the "fallacy fallacy" of arguing that a proposition is false because it has been presented as the conclusion of a fallacious argument. Remember always that fallacious arguments can arrive at true conclusions.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Take the fraction 16/64. Now, canceling a six on top and a six on the bottom, we get that 16/64 = 1/4."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Wait a second! You can't just cancel the six!"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Oh, so you're telling us 16/64 is not equal to 1/4, are you?"</p>
