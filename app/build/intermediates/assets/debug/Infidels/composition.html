  <h4><a id="composition" name="composition">Composition</a></h4>

  <p>The Fallacy of Composition is to conclude that a property shared by a number of individual items, is also shared by a collection of those items; or that a property of the parts of an object, must also be a property of the whole thing. Examples:</p>

  <p class="quote">"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very lightweight."</p>

  <p class="quote">"A car uses less petrochemicals and causes less pollution than a bus. Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses."</p>

  <p>A related form of fallacy of composition is the "just" fallacy, or <a href="http://andrewlias.blogspot.com/2004/05/fallacy-of-mediocrity.html">fallacy of mediocrity</a>. This is the fallacy that assumes that any given member of a set must be limited to the attributes that are held in common with all the other members of the set. Example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Humans are just animals, so we should not concern ourselves with justice; we should just obey the law of the jungle."</p>

  <p>Here the fallacy is to reason that because we are animals, we can have only properties which animals have; that nothing can distinguish us as a special case.</p>
