  <h4><a id="analogy" name="analogy">Extended analogy</a></h4>

  <p>The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over. The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other.</p>

  <p>Here's real example from an online debate about anti-cryptography legislation:</p>

  <p class="quote">"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther King."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation? How dare you!"</p>
