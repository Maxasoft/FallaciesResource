  <h4><a id="baculum" name="baculum">Argumentum ad baculum (Appeal to force or fear)</a></h4>

  <p>An Appeal to Force happens when someone resorts to force (or the threat of force) to try and push others to accept a conclusion. This fallacy is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as "might makes right." The threat doesn't have to come directly from the person arguing. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible. All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell."</p>

  <p class="quote">"In any case, I know your phone number and I know where you live. Have I mentioned I am licensed to carry concealed weapons?"</p>
