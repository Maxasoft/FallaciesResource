  <h4><a id="accident" name="accident">Dicto simpliciter / Fallacy of accident / Sweeping generalization</a></h4>

  <p>A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation, but the features of that particular situation mean the rule is inapplicable. It's the error made when you go from the general to the specific. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Christians generally dislike atheists. You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists."</p>

  <p>This fallacy is often committed by people who try to decide moral and legal questions by mechanically applying general rules.</p>
