  <h4><a id="complexq" name="complexq">Complex question / Fallacy of interrogation / Fallacy of presupposition</a></h4>

  <p>This is the interrogative form of <a href="begging.html">Begging the Question</a>. One example is the classic loaded question:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Have you stopped beating your wife?"</p>

  <p>The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked. This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Where did you hide the money you stole?"</p>

  <p>Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:</p>

  <p class="quote">"How long will this EU interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?"</p>

  <p>or</p>

  <p class="quote">"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?"</p>

  <p>Another form of this fallacy is to ask for an explanation of something which is untrue or not yet established.</p>
