  <h4><a id="strawman" name="strawman">Straw man</a></h4>

  <p>The straw man fallacy is when you misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, knock down that misrepresented position, then conclude that the original position has been demolished. It's a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.</p>

  <p class="quote">"To be an atheist, you have to believe with absolute certainty that there is no God. In order to convince yourself with absolute certainty, you must examine all the Universe and all the places where God could possibly be. Since you obviously haven't, your position is indefensible."</p>

  <p>The above straw man argument appears at about once a week on the net. If you can't see what's wrong with it, read the "<a href="intro.html">Introduction to Atheism</a>" document.</p>
