  <h4><a id="equivocation" name="equivocation">Equivocation / Fallacy of four terms</a></h4>

  <p>Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"What could be more affordable than free software? But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable."</p>

  <p>One way to avoid this fallacy is to choose your terminology carefully before beginning the argument, and avoid words like "free" which have many meanings.</p>
