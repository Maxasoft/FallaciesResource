  <h4><a id="noncausa" name="noncausa">Non causa pro causa</a></h4>

  <p>The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when something is identified as the cause of an event, but it has not actually been <EM>shown</EM> to be the cause. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared. So God cured me of the headache."</p>

  <p>This is known as a false cause fallacy. Two specific forms of non causa pro causa fallacy are the <a href="cumhoc.html">cum hoc ergo propter hoc</a> and <a href="posthoc.html">post hoc ergo propter hoc</a> fallacies.</p>
