  <h4><a id="slope" name="slope">Slippery slope argument</a></h4>

  <p>This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events. There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"If we legalize marijuana, then more people would start to take crack and heroin, and we'd have to legalize those too. Before long we'd have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare. Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana."</p>
