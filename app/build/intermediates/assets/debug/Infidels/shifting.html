  <p>The burden of proof is always on the person asserting something. Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of <a href="ignorantiam.html">Argumentum ad Ignorantiam</a>, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion. The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.</p>

  <p>For further discussion of this idea, see the "<a href="intro.html#assertions" TITLE="Introduction to Atheism">Introduction to Atheism</a>" document.</p>
