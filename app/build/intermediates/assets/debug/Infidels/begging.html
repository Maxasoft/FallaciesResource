  <h4><a id="begging" name="begging">Petitio principii</a> (Begging the question)</h4>

  <p>This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached. Typically the premises of the argument implicitly assume the result which the argument purports to prove, in a disguised form. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"The Bible is the word of God. The word of God cannot be doubted, and the Bible states that the Bible is true. Therefore the Bible must be true.</p>

  <p>Begging the question is similar to <a href="circulus.html">circulus in demonstrando</a>, where the conclusion is exactly the same as the premise.</p>
