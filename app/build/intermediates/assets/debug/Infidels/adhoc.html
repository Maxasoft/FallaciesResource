  <h4><a id="adhoc" name="adhoc">Ad hoc</a> (for this purpose only)</h4>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, there is a difference between argument and explanation. If we're interested in establishing A, and B is offered as evidence, the statement "A because B" is an argument. If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then "A because B" is not an argument, it's an explanation.</p>

  <p>The Ad Hoc fallacy is to give an after-the-fact explanation which doesn't apply to other situations. Often this ad hoc explanation will be dressed up to look like an argument. For example, if we assume that God treats all people equally, then the following is an ad hoc explanation:</p>

  <p class="quote">"I was healed from cancer."</p>

  <p class="quote">"Praise the Lord, then. He is your healer."</p>

  <p class="quote">"So, will He heal others who have cancer?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Er... The ways of God are mysterious."</p>
