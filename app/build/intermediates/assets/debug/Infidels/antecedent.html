  <h4><a id="antecedent" name="antecedent">Denial of the antecedent</a></h4>

  <p>This fallacy is an argument of the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false." The <a href="ConstructingALogicalArgument.html#truthtable">truth table for implication</a> makes it clear why this is a fallacy.</p>

  <p>Note that this fallacy is different from <a href="posthoc.html">Non Causa Pro Causa</a>. That has the form "A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false," where A does <EM>not</EM> in fact imply B at all. Here, the problem isn't that the implication is invalid; rather it's that the falseness of A doesn't allow us to deduce anything about B.</p>

  <p class="quote">"If the God of the Bible appeared to me, personally, that would certainly prove that Christianity was true. But God has never appeared to me, so the Bible must be a work of fiction."</p>

  <p>This is the converse of the fallacy of <a href="consequent.html">Affirmation of the Consequent</a>.</p>
