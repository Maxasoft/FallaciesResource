  <h4><a id="tuquoque" name="tuquoque">Tu quoque</a></h4>

  <p>This is the famous "you too" fallacy. It occurs if you argue that an action is acceptable because your opponent has performed it. For instance:</p>

  <p class="quote">"You're just being randomly abusive."</p>

  <p class="quote">"So? You've been abusive too."</p>

  <p>This is a personal attack, and is therefore a special case of <a href="hominem.html">Argumentum ad Hominem</a>.</p>
