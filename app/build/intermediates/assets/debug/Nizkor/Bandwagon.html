    Fallacy: Bandwagon</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Also Known as: Peer Pressure.</p>
  <h4>
    <a name="description">Description of Bandwagon</a></h4>
  <p>
    The Bandwagon is a fallacy in which a threat of rejection by one's peers (or peer
    pressure) is substituted for evidence in an "argument." This line of "reasoning"
    has the following form:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Person P is pressured by his/her peers or threatened with rejection.</li>
    <li>Therefore person P's claim X is false.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This line of "reasoning" is fallacious because peer pressure and threat of rejection
    do not constitute evidence for rejecting a claim. This is expecially clear in the
    following example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Joe: "Bill, I know you think that 1+1=2. But we don't accept that sort of thing
    in our group. "
    <br />
    Bill: "I was just joking. Of course I don't believe that."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It is clear that the pressure from Bill's group has no bearing on the truth of the
    claim that 1+1=2.</p>
  <p>
    It should be noted that loyalty to a group and the need to belong can give people
    very strong reasons to conform to the views and positions of those groups. Further,
    from a practical standpoint we must often compromise our beliefs in order to belong
    to groups. However, this feeling of loyalty or the need to belong simply do not
    constitute evidence for a claim.</p>
  <h4>
    <a name="examples">Examples of Bandwagon</a></h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Bill says that he likes the idea that people should work for their welfare when
        they can. His friends laugh at him, accuse him of fascist leanings, and threaten
        to ostracize him from their group. He decides to recant and abandon his position
        to avoid rejection.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Bill: "I like classical music and I think it is of higher quality than most modern
        music."
        <br />
        Jill: "That stuff is for old people."
        <br />
        Dave: "Yeah, only real woosies listen to that crap. Besides, Anthrax rules! It Rules!"
        <br />
        Bill: "Well, I don't really like it that much. Anthrax is much better."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Bill thinks that welfare is needed in some cases. His friends in the Young Republicans
        taunt him every time he makes his views known. He accepts their views in order to
        avoid rejection.</p>
