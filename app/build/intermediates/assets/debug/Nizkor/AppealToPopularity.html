	<h3>Fallacy: Appeal to Popularity</h3>
	<hr />
	
	<p>Also Known as: Ad Populum
	
	<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Popularity</a></h4>
	
	<p>The Appeal to Popularity has the following form:
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Most people approve of X (have favorable emotions towards X).
	<li>Therefore X is true. 
	</ol>
	
	<p>The basic idea is that a claim is accepted as being true simply
	because most people are favorably inclined towards the claim. More
	formally, the fact that most people have favorable emotions associated
	with the claim is substituted in place of actual evidence for the claim.
	A person falls prey to this fallacy if he accepts a claim as being true
	simply because most other people approve of the claim.
	
	<p>It is clearly fallacious to accept the approval of the majority as
	evidence for a claim. For example, suppose that a skilled speaker
	managed to get most people to absolutely love the claim that 1+1=3. It
	would still not be rational to accept this claim simply because most
	people approved of it. After all, mere approval is no substitute for a
	mathematical proof. At one time people approved of claims such as
	"the world is flat", "humans cannot survive at speeds
	greater than 25 miles per hour", "the sun revolves around the
	earth" but all these claims turned out to be false.
	
	<p>This sort of "reasoning" is quite common and can be quite
	an effective persusasive device. Since most humans tend to conform with
	the views of the majority, convincing a person that the majority
	approves of a claim is often an effective way to get him to accept it.
	Advertisers often use this tactic when they attempt to sell products by
	claiming that everyone uses and loves their products. In such cases they
	hope that people will accept the (purported) approval of others as a
	good reason to buy the product.
	
	<p>This fallacy is vaguely similar to such fallacies as
	<a href="AppealToBelief.html">Appeal to Belief</a>
	and
	<a href="AppealToCommonPractice.html">Appeal to Common Practice</a>.
	However, in the case of an Ad Populum the
	appeal is to the fact that most people approve of a claim. In the case
	of an
	<a href="AppealToBelief.html">Appeal to Belief</a>,
	the appeal is to the fact that most people
	believe a claim. In the case of an
	<a href="AppealToCommonPractice.html">Appeal to Common Practice</a>,
	the appeal
	is to the fact that many people take the action in question.
	
	<p>This fallacy is closely related to the
	<a href="AppealToEmotion.html">Appeal to Emotion</a>
	fallacy, as discussed in the entry for that fallacy.
	
	<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Appeal to Popularity</a></h4>
	
	<ol>
	
	<p><li>"My fellow Americans...there has been some talk that the
	government is overstepping its bounds by allowing police to enter
	peoples' homes without the warrants traditionally required by the
	Constitution. However, these are dangerous times and dangerous times
	require appropriate actions. I have in my office thousands of letters
	from people who let me know, in no uncertain terms, that they heartily
	endorse the war against crime in these United States. Because of this
	overwhelming approval, it is evident that the police are doing the right
	thing."
	
	<p><li>"I read the other day that most people really like the new
	gun control laws. I was sort of suspicious of them, but I guess if most
	people like them, then they must be okay."
	
	<p><li>Jill and Jane have some concerns that the rules their sorority has
	set are racist in character. Since Jill is a decent person, she brings
	her concerns up in the next meeting. The president of the sorority
	assures her that there is nothing wrong with the rules, since the
	majority of the sisters like them. Jane accepts this ruling but Jill
	decides to leave the sorority.
