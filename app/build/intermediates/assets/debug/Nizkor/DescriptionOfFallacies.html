	<hr />
	
	<p>In order to understand what a fallacy is, one must understand what an
	argument is. Very briefly, an argument consists of one or more premises
	and one conclusion. A premise is a statement (a sentence that is either
	true or false) that is offered in support of the claim being made, which
	is the conclusion (which is also a sentence that is either true or
	false).
	
	<p>There are two main types of arguments:
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Deductive</li>
	  <li>Inductive</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A deductive argument is an argument such that the premises provide (or
	appear to provide) complete support for the conclusion.
	<p>An inductive	argument is an argument such that the premises provide (or appear to
	provide) some degree of support (but less than complete support) for the
	conclusion. If the premises actually provide the required degree of
	support for the conclusion, then the argument is a good one. A good
	deductive argument is known as a valid argument and is such that if all
	its premises are true, then its conclusion must be true. If all the
	argument is valid and actually has all true premises, then it is known
	as a sound argument. If it is invalid or has one or more false premises,
	it will be unsound. A good inductive argument is known as a strong (or
	"cogent") inductive argument. It is such that if the premises
	are true, the conclusion is likely to be true.
	
	<p>A fallacy is, very generally, an error in reasoning. This differs
	from a factual error, which is simply being wrong about the facts. To be
	more specific, a fallacy is an "argument" in which the
	premises given for the conclusion do not provide the needed degree of
	support. A deductive fallacy is a deductive argument that is invalid (it
	is such that it could have all true premises and still have a false
	conclusion). An inductive fallacy is less formal than a deductive
	fallacy. They are simply "arguments" which appear to be
	inductive arguments, but the premises do not provided enough support for
	the conclusion. In such cases, even if the premises were true, the
	conclusion would not be more likely to be true.        

	<h4><a name="fallacies-examples">Examples of Fallacies</a></h4>
	
	<ol>
	
	<p><li>Inductive Argument
	
	<p>Premise 1:  Most American cats are domestic house cats.
	<br />Premise 2:  Bill is an American cat.
	<br />Conclusion: Bill is domestic house cat. 
	
	<p><li>Factual Error
	
	<p>Columbus is the capital of the United States.
	
	<p><li>Deductive Fallacy
	
	<p>Premise 1: If Portland is the capital of Maine, then it is in Maine.
	<br />Premise 2: Portland is in Maine.
	<br />Conclusion: Portland is the capital of Maine.
	<br />(Portland is in Maine, but Augusta is the capital. Portland is the largest city in Maine, though.)
	
	<p><li>Inductive Fallacy
	
	<p>Premise 1: Having just arrived in Ohio, I saw a white squirrel.
	<br />Conclusion: All Ohio Squirrels are white.
	<br />(While there are many, many squirrels in Ohio, the white ones are very rare).
