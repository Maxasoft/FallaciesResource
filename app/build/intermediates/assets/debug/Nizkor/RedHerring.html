<h3>Fallacy: Red Herring</h3>
<hr />
<p>Also Known as: Smoke Screen, Wild Goose Chase.

<h4><a name="description">Description of Red Herring</a></h4>

<p>A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented
in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is
to "win" an argument by leading attention away from the
argument and to another topic. This sort of "reasoning" has
the following form:

<ol>
<p><li>Topic A is under discussion.
<li>Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when topic B is actually not relevant to topic A).
<li>Topic A is abandoned.
</ol>

<p>This sort of "reasoning" is fallacious because merely
changing the topic of discussion hardly counts as an argument against a
claim.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Red Herring</a></h4>

<p><li>"We admit that this measure is popular. But we also urge you
to note that there are so many bond issues on this ballot that the whole
thing is getting ridiculous."

<p><li>"Argument" for a tax cut:

<p>"You know, I've begun to think that there is some merit in the
Republican's tax cut plan. I suggest that you come up with something
like it, because If we Democrats are going to survive as a party, we
have got to show that we are as tough-minded as the Republicans, since
that is what the public wants."

<p><li>"Argument" for making  grad school requirements
stricter:

<p>"I think there is great merit in making the requirements
stricter for the graduate students. I recommend that you support it,
too. After all, we are in a budget crisis and we do not want our
salaries affected."
