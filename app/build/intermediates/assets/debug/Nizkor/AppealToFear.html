	<h3>Fallacy: Appeal to Fear</h3>
	<hr />
	
	<p>Also Known as: Scare Tactics, Appeal to Force, Ad Baculum
	
	<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Fear</a></h4>
	
	<p>The Appeal to Fear is a fallacy with the following pattern:
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Y is presented (a claim that is intended to produce fear).
	<li>Therefore claim X is true (a claim that is generally, but need not be, related to Y in some manner).
	</ol>
	
	<p>This line of "reasoning" is fallacious because creating
	fear in people does not constitute evidence for a claim.
	
	<p>It is important to distinguish between a rational reason to believe
	(RRB) (evidence) and a prudential reason to believe (PRB) (motivation). A
	RRB is evidence that objectively and logically supports the claim. A PRB
	is a reason to accept the belief because of some external factor (such
	as fear, a threat, or a benefit or harm that may stem from the belief)
	that is relevant to what a person values but is not relevant to the
	truth or falsity of the claim. For example, it might be prudent to not
	fail the son of your department chairperson because you fear he will
	make life tough for you. However, this does not provide evidence for the
	claim that the son deserves to pass the class.
	
	<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Appeal to Fear</a></h4>
	
	<ol>
	
	<p><li>"You know, Professor Smith, I really need to get an A in this
	class. I'd like to stop by during your office hours later to discuss my
	grade. I'll be in your building anyways, visiting my father. He's your
	dean, by the way. I'll see you later."
	
	<p><li>"I don't think a Red Ryder BB rifle would make a good present
	for you. They are very dangerous and you'll put your eye out. Now, don't
	you agree that you should think of another gift idea?"
	
	<p><li>You must believe that God exists. After all, if you do not accept the
	existence of God, then you will face the horrors of hell."
	
	<p><li>"You shouldn't say such things against multiculturalism! If the
	chair heard what you were saying, you would never receive tenure. So,
	you had just better learn to accept that it is simply wrong to speak out
	against it."
