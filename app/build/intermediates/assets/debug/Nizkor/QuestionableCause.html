<h3>Fallacy: Questional Cause</h3>
<hr />
<h4><a name="description">Description of Questionable Cause</a></h4>

<p>This fallacy has the following general form:

<ol>
<p><li>A and B are associated on a regular basis.
<li>Therefore A is the cause of B.
</ol>

<p>The general idea behind this fallacy is that it is an error in
reasoning to conclude that one thing causes another simply because
the two are associated on a regular basis. More formally, this
fallacy is committed when it is concluded that A is the cause of B
simply because they are associated on a regular basis. The error
being made is that a causal conclusion is being drawn from
inadequate evidence.

<p>The Questionable Cause Fallacy is actually a general type of
fallacy. Any causal fallacy that involves an error in a reasoning
due to a failure to adequately investigate the suspected cause is a
fallacy of this type. Thus, fallacies like
<a href="PostHoc.html">Post Hoc</a>
and
<a href="ConfusingCauseAndEffect.html">Confusing Cause and Effect</a>
are specific examples of the general Questionable Cause Fallacy.

<p>Causal reasoning can be quite difficult since causation is a
rather complex philosophic issue. The complexity of causation is
briefly discussed in the context of the specific versions of this
fallacy.

<p>The key to avoiding the Questionable Cause fallacy is to take due
care in drawing causal conclusions. This requires taking steps to
adequately investigate the phenomena in question as well using the
proper methods of careful investigation.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Questionable Cause</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>Joe gets a chain letter that threatens him with dire
consequences if he breaks the chain. He laughs at it and throws it
in the garbage. On his way to work he slips and breaks his leg. When
he gets back from the hospital he sends out 200 copies of the chain
letter, hoping to avoid further accidents.

<p><li>When investigating a small pond a group of graduate students
found that there was a severe drop in the fish population. Further
investigation revealed that the fishes' food supply had also been
severely reduced. At first the students believed that the lack of
food was killing the fish, but then they realized they had to find
what was causing the decline in the food supply. The students
suspected acid rain was the cause of both the reduction in the fish
population as well as the food supply. However, the local business
council insisted that it was just the lack of food that caused the
reduction in the fish population. Most of the townspeople agreed
with this conclusion since it seemed pretty obvious that a lack of
food would cause fish to die.
