<h3>Fallacy: Slippery Slope</h3>
<hr />

<p>Also Known as: The Camel's Nose.

<h4><a name="description">Description of Slippery Slope</a></h4>

<p>The Slippery Slope is a fallacy in which a person asserts that some
event must inevitably follow from another without any argument for the
inevitability of the event in question. In most cases, there are a
series of steps or gradations between one event and the one in question
and no reason is given as to why the intervening steps or gradations will
simply be bypassed. This "argument" has the following form:

<ol>
<p><li>Event X has occurred (or will or might occur).
<li>Therefore event Y will inevitably happen.
</ol>

<p>This sort of "reasoning" is fallacious because there is no
reason to believe that one event must inevitably follow from another
without an argument for such a claim. This is especially clear in cases
in which there is a significant number of steps or gradations between
one event and another.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Slippery Slope</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>"We have to stop the tuition increase! The next thing you
know, they'll be charging $40,000 a semester!"

<p><li>"The US shouldn't get involved militarily in other
countries. Once the government sends in a few troops, it will then send
in thousands to die."

<p><li>"You can never give anyone a break. If you do, they'll walk
all over you."

<p><li>"We've got to stop them from banning pornography. Once they
start banning one form of literature, they will never stop. Next thing
you know, they will be burning all the books!"
