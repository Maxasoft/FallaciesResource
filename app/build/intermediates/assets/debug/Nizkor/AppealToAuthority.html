	<h3>Fallacy: Appeal to Authority</h3>
	<hr />
	
	<p>Also Known as: Fallacious Appeal to Authority, Misuse of Authority,
	Irrelevant Authority, Questionable Authority, Inappropriate Authority,
	Ad Verecundiam
	
	<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Authority</a></h4>
	
	<p>An Appeal to Authority is a fallacy with the following form:
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Person A is (claimed to be) an authority on subject S.
	<li>Person A makes claim C about subject S.
	<li>Therefore, C is true.
	</ol>
	
	<p>This fallacy is committed when the person in question is not a
	legitimate authority on the subject. More formally, if person A is not
	qualified to make reliable claims in subject S, then the argument will
	be fallacious.
	
	<p>This sort of reasoning is fallacious when the person in question is
	not an expert. In such cases the reasoning is flawed because  the fact
	that an unqualified person makes a claim does not provide any
	justification for the claim. The claim could be true, but the fact that
	an unqualified person made the claim does not provide any rational
	reason to accept the claim as true.
	
	<p>When a person falls prey to this fallacy, they are accepting a claim
	as true without there being adequate evidence to do so. More
	specifically, the person is accepting the claim because they erroneously
	believe that the person making the claim is a legitimate expert and
	hence that the claim is reasonable to accept. Since people have a
	tendency to believe authorities (and there are, in fact, good reasons to
	accept some claims made by authorities) this fallacy is a fairly common
	one.
	
	<p>Since this sort of reasoning is fallacious only when the person is
	not a legitimate authority in a particular context, it is necessary to
	provide some acceptable standards of assessment.  The following
	standards are widely accepted:
	
	<ol>
	
	<p><li>The person has sufficient expertise in the subject matter in
	question.
	
	<p>Claims made by a person who lacks the needed degree of expertise to
	make a reliable claim will, obviously, not be well supported. In
	contrast, claims made by a person with the needed degree of expertise
	will be supported by the person's reliability in the area.
	
	<p>Determining whether or not a person has the needed degree of
	expertise can often be very difficult. In academic fields (such as
	philosophy, engineering, history, etc.), the person's formal education,
	academic performance, publications, membership in professional
	societies, papers presented, awards won and so forth can all be reliable
	indicators of expertise. Outside of academic fields, other standards
	will apply. For example, having sufficient expertise to make a reliable
	claim about how to tie a shoe lace only requires the ability to tie the
	shoe lace and impart that information to others. It should  be noted
	that being an expert does not always require having a university degree.
	Many people have high degrees of expertise in sophisticated subjects
	without having ever attended a university. Further, it should not be
	simply assumed that a person with a degree is an expert.
	
	<p>Of course, what is required to be an expert is often a matter of
	great debate.  For example, some people have (and do) claim expertise in
	certain (even all) areas because of a divine inspiration or a special
	gift. The followers of such people accept such credentials as
	establishing the person's expertise while others often see these
	self-proclaimed experts as deluded or even as charlatans. In other
	situations, people  debate over what sort of education and experience is
	needed to be an expert. Thus, what one person may take to be a
	fallacious appeal another person might take to be a well supported line
	of reasoning. Fortunately, many cases do not involve such debate.
	
	<p><li>The claim being made by the person is within her area(s) of
	expertise.
	
	<p>If a person makes a claim about some subject outside of his area(s)
	of expertise, then the person is not an expert in that context. Hence,
	the claim in question is not backed by the required degree of expertise
	and is not reliable.
	
	<p>It is very important to remember that because of the vast scope of
	human knowledge and skill it is simply not possible for one person to be
	an expert on everything. Hence, experts will only be true experts in
	respect to certain subject areas. In most other areas they will have
	little or no expertise. Thus, it is important to determine what subject
	area a claim falls under.
	
	<p>It is also very important to note that expertise in one area does not
	automatically confer expertise in another. For example, being an expert
	physicist does not automatically make a person an expert on morality or
	politics. Unfortunately, this is often overlooked or intentionally
	ignored. In fact, a great deal of advertising rests on a violation of
	this condition. As anyone who watches television knows, it is extremely
	common to get famous actors and sports heroes to endorse products that
	they are not qualified to assess. For example, a person may be a great
	actor, but that does not automatically make him an expert on cars or
	shaving or underwear or diets or politics.
	
	<p><li>There is an adequate degree of agreement among the other experts
	in the subject in question.
	
	<p>If there is a significant amount of legitimate dispute among the
	experts within a subject, then it will fallacious to make an Appeal to
	Authority using the disputing experts. This is because for almost any
	claim being made and "supported" by one expert there will be a
	counterclaim that is made and "supported" by another expert.
	In such cases an Appeal to Authority would tend to be futile. In such
	cases, the dispute has to be settled by consideration of the actual
	issues under dispute. Since either side in such a dispute can invoke
	experts, the dispute cannot be rationally settled by Appeals to
	Authority.
	
	<p>There are many fields in which there is a significant amount of
	legitimate dispute. Economics is a good example of such a disputed
	field. Anyone who is familiar with economics knows that there are many
	plausible theories that are incompatible with one another.  Because of
	this, one expert economist could sincerely claim that the deficit is the
	key factor while another equally qualified individual could assert the
	exact opposite. Another area where dispute is very common (and well
	known) is in the area of psychology and psychiatry. As has been
	demonstrated in various trials, it is possible to find one expert that
	will assert that an individual is insane and not competent to stand
	trial and to find another equally qualified expert who will testify,
	under oath, that the same individual is both sane and competent to stand
	trial. Obviously, one cannot rely on an Appeal to Authority in such a
	situation without making a fallacious argument. Such an argument would
	be fallacious since the evidence would not warrant accepting the
	conclusion.
	
	<p>It is important to keep in mind that no field has complete agreement,
	so some degree of dispute is acceptable. How much is acceptable is, of
	course, a matter of serious debate. It is also important to keep in mind
	that even a field with a great deal of internal dispute  might contain
	areas of significant agreement. In such cases, an Appeal to Authority
	could be legitimate.
	
	<p><li>The person in question is not significantly  biased.
	
	<p>If an expert is significantly biased then the claims he makes within
	his are of bias will be less reliable. Since a biased expert will not be
	reliable, an Argument from Authority based on a biased expert will be
	fallacious. This is because the evidence will not justify accepting the
	claim.
	
	<p>Experts, being people, are vulnerable to biases and predjudices. If
	there is evidence that a person is biased in some manner that would
	affect the reliability of her claims, then an Argument from Authority
	based on that person is likely to be fallacious. Even if the claim is
	actually true, the fact that the expert is biased weakens the argument.
	This is because there would be reason to believe that the expert might
	not be making the claim because he has carefully considered it using his
	expertise. Rather, there would be reason to believe that the claim is
	being made because of the expert's bias or prejudice.
	
	<p>It is important to remember that no person is completely objective.
	At the very least, a person will be favorable towards her own views
	(otherwise she would probably not hold them). Because of this, some
	degree of bias must be accepted, provided that the bias is not
	significant. What counts as a significant degree of bias is open to
	dispute and can vary a great deal from case to case. For example, many
	people would probably suspect that doctors who were paid by tobacco
	companies to research the effects of smoking would be biased while other
	people might believe (or claim) that they would be able to remain
	objective.
	
	<p><li>The area of expertise is a legitimate area or discipline.
	
	<p>Certain areas in which a person may claim expertise may have no
	legitimacy or validity as areas of knowledge or study. Obviously, claims
	made in such areas will not be very reliable.
	
	<p>What counts as a legitimate area of expertise is sometimes difficult
	to determine. However, there are cases which are fairly clear cut. For
	example, if a person claimed to be an expert at something he called
	"chromabullet therapy" and asserted that firing painted rifle
	bullets at a person would cure cancer it would not be very reasonable to
	accept his claim based on his "expertise." After all, his
	expertise is in an area which is devoid of legitimate content. The
	general idea is that to be a legitimate expert a person must have
	mastery over a real field or area of knowledge.
	
	<p>As noted above, determining the legitimacy of a field can often be
	difficult. In European history, various scientists had to struggle with
	the Church and established traditions to establish the validity of their
	discliplines. For example, experts on evolution faced an uphill battle
	in getting the legitimacy of their area accepted.
	
	<p>A modern example involves psychic phenomenon. Some people claim that
	they are certified "master psychics" and that they are
	actually experts in the field. Other people contend that their claims of
	being certified "master psychics" are simply absurd since
	there is no real content to such an area of expertise. If these people
	are right, then anyone who accepts the claims of these "master
	psychics" as true are victims of a fallacious appeal to authority.
	
	<p><li>The authority in question must be identified.
	
	<p>A common variation of the typical Appeal to Authority fallacy is an
	Appeal to an Unnamed Authority. This fallacy is also known as an Appeal
	to an Unidentified Authority.
	
	<p>This fallacy is committed when a person asserts that a claim is true
	because an expert or authority makes the claim and the person does not
	actually identify the expert. Since the expert is not named or
	identified, there is no way to tell if the person is actually an expert.
	Unless the person is identified and has his expertise established, there
	is no reason to accept the claim.
	
	<p>This sort of reasoning is not unusual. Typically, the person making
	the argument will  say things like "I have a book that
	says...", or "they say...", or "the experts
	say...", or "scientists believe that...", or "I read
	in the paper.." or "I saw on TV..." or some similar
	statement. in such cases the person is often hoping that the listener(s)
	will simply accept the unidentified source as a legitimate authority and
	believe the claim being made. If a person accepts the claim simply
	because they accept the unidentified source as an expert (without good
	reason to do so), he has fallen prey to this fallacy.
	
	</ol>
	
	<p>As suggested above, not all Appeals to Authority are fallacious. This
	is fortunate since people have to rely on experts. This is because no
	one person can be an expert on everything and people do not have the
	time or ability to investigate every single claim themselves.
	
	<p>In many cases, Arguments from Authority will be good arguments. For
	example, when a person goes to a skilled doctor and the doctor tells him
	that he has a cold, then the the patient has good reason to accept the
	doctor's conclusion. As another example, if a person's computer is
	acting odd and his friend, who is a computer expert, tells him it is
	probably his hard drive then he has good reason to believe her.
	
	<p>What distinguishes a fallacious Appeal to Authority from a good
	Appeal to Authority is that the argument meets the six conditions
	discussed above.
	
	<p>In a good Appeal to Authority, there is reason to believe the claim
	because the expert says the claim is true. This is because a person who
	is a legitimate expert is more likely to be right than wrong when making
	considered claims within her area of expertise. In a sense, the claim is
	being accepted because it is reasonable to believe that the expert has
	tested the claim and found it to be reliable. So, if the expert has
	found it to be reliable, then it is reasonable to accept it as being
	true. Thus, the listener is accepting a claim based on the testimony of
	the expert.
	
	<p>It should be noted that even a good Appeal to Authority is not an
	exceptionally strong argument. After all, in such cases a claim is being
	accepted as true simply because a person is asserting that it is true.
	The person may be an expert, but her expertise does not really bear on
	the truth of the claim. This is because the expertise of a person does
	not actually determine whether the claim is true or false. Hence,
	arguments that deal directly with evidence relating to the claim itself
	will tend to be stronger.
	
	<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Appeal to Authority</a></h4>
	
	<ol>
	
	<p><li>Bill and Jane are arguing about the morality of abortion:
	
	<p>Bill: "I believe that abortion is morally acceptable. After all, a woman should have a right to her own body."
	<br />Jane: "I disagree completely. Dr. Johan Skarn says that abortion is always morally wrong, regardless of the situation. He has to be right, after all, he is a respected expert in his field."
	<br />Bill: "I've never heard of Dr. Skarn. Who is he?"
	<br />Jane: "He's the guy that won the Nobel Prize in physics for his work on cold fusion."
	<br />Bill: "I see. Does he have any expertise in morality or ethics?"
	<br />Jane: "I don't know. But he's a world famous expert, so I believe him."
	
	<p><li>Dave and Kintaro are arguing about Stalin's reign in the Soviet Union. Dave has been arguing that Stalin was a great leader while Kintaro disagrees with him.
	
	<p>Kintaro: "I don't see how you can consider Stalin to be a great leader. He killed millions of his own people, he crippled the Soviet economy, kept most of the people in fear and laid the foundations for the violence that is occuring in much of Eastern Europe."
	<br />Dave: "Yeah, well you say that. However, I have a book at home that says that Stalin was acting in the best interest of the people. The millions that were killed were vicious enemies of the state and they had to be killed to protect the rest of the peaceful citizens. This book lays it all out, so it has to be true."
	
	<p><li>I'm not a doctor, but I play one on the hit series "Bimbos and Studmuffins in the OR." You can take it from me that when you need a fast acting, effective and safe pain killer there is nothing better than MorphiDope 2000. That is my considered medical opinion.
	
	<p><li>Siphwe and Sasha are having a conversation:
	
	<p>Sasha: "I played the lottery today and I know I am going to win something."
	<br />Siphwe: "What did you do, rig the outcome?"
	<br />Sasha: "No, silly. I called my Super Psychic Buddy at the 1-900-MindPower number. After consulting his magic Californian Tarot deck, he told me my lucky numbers."
	<br />Siphwe: "And you believed him?"
	<br />Sasha: "Certainly, he is a certified Californian Master-Mind Psychic. That is why I believe what he has to say. I mean, like, who else would know what my lucky numbers are?"
