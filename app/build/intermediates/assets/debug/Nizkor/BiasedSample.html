  <h3>Fallacy: Biased Sample</h3>
  <hr />

  <p>Also Known as: Biased Statistics, Loaded Sample, Prejudiced
  Statistics, Prejudiced Sample, Loaded Statistics, Biased Induction,
  Biased Generalization

  <h4><a name="description">Description of Biased Sample</a></h4>

  <p>This fallacy is committed when a person draws a conclusion about a
  population based on a sample that is biased or prejudiced in some
  manner. It has the following form:

  <ol>
  <li>Sample S, which is biased, is taken from population P.
  <li>Conclusion C is drawn about Population P based on S.
  </ol>

  <p>The person committing the fallacy is misusing the following type of
  reasoning, which is known variously as Inductive Generalization,
  Generalization, and Statistical Generalization:

  <ol>
  <li>X percent  of all observed A's are B's.
  <li>Therefore X percent  of all A's are Bs.
  </ol>

  <p>The fallacy is committed when the sample of A's is likely to be
  biased in some manner.  A sample is biased or loaded when the method
  used to take the sample is likely to result in a sample that does not
  adequately represent the population from which it is drawn.

  <p>Biased samples are generally not very reliable. As a blatant case,
  imagine that a person is taking a sample from a truckload of small
  colored balls, some of which are metal and some of which are plastic. If
  he used a magnet to select his sample, then his sample would include a
  disproportionate number of metal balls (after all, the sample will
  probably be made up entirely of the metal balls). In this case, any
  conclusions he might draw about the whole population of balls would be
  unreliable since he would have few or no plastic balls in the sample.

  <p>The general idea is that biased samples are less likely to contain
  numbers proportional to the whole population. For example, if a person
  wants to find out what most Americans thought about gun control, a poll
  taken at an NRA meeting would be a biased sample.

  <p>Since the Biased Sample fallacy is committed when the sample (the
  observed instances) is biased or loaded, it is important to have samples
  that are not biased making a generalization. The best way to do this is
  to take samples in ways that avoid bias. There are, in general, three
  types of samples that are aimed at avoiding bias. The general idea is
  that these methods (when used properly) will result in a sample that
  matches the whole population fairly closely. The three types of samples
  are as follows

  <ol>

  <p><li>Random Sample: This is a sample that is taken in such a way that
  nothing but chance determines which members of the population are
  selected for the sample. Ideally, any individual member of the
  population has the same chance as being selected as any other. This type
  of sample avoids being biased because a biased sample is one that is
  taken in such a way that some members of the population have a
  significantly greater chance of being selected for the sample than other
  members. Unfortunately, creating an ideal random sample is often very
  difficult.

  <p><li>Stratified Sample: This is a sample that is taken by using the
  following steps: 1) The relevant strata (population subgroups) are
  identified, 2) The number of members in each stratum is determined and
  3) A random sample is taken from each stratum in exact proportion to its
  size. This method is obviously  most useful when dealing with stratified
  populations. For example, a person's income often influences how she
  votes, so when conducting a presidential poll it would be a good idea to
  take a stratified sample using economic classes as the basis for
  determining the strata. This method avoids loaded samples by (ideally)
  ensuring that each stratum of the population is adequately represented.

  <p><li>Time Lapse Sample: This type of sample is taken by taking a
  stratified or random sample and then taking at least one more sample
  with a significant lapse of time between them. After the two samples are
  taken, they can be compared for changes. This method of sample taking is
  very important when making predictions. A prediction based on only one
  sample is likely to be a
  <a href="HastyGeneralization.html">Hasty Generalization</a>
  (because the sample is likely to be too small to cover past, present and
   future populations) or a Biased Sample (because the sample will only
  include instances from one time period).

  </ol>

  <p>People often commit Biased Sample because of bias or prejudice. For
  example, a person might intentionally or unintentionally seek out people
  or events that support his bias. As an example, a person who is pushing
  a particular scientific theory might tend to gather samples that are
  biased in favor of that theory.

  <p>People also commonly commit this fallacy because of laziness or
  sloppiness. It is very easy to simply take a sample from what happens to
  be easily available rather than taking the time and effort to generate
  an adequate sample and draw a justified conclusion.

  <p>It is important to keep in mind that bias is relative to the purpose
  of the sample. For example, if Bill wanted to know what NRA members
  thought about a gun control law, then taking a sampleat a NRA meeting
  would not be biased. However, if Bill wanted to determine what Americans
  in general thought about the law, then a sample taken at an NRA meeting
  would be biased.

  <h4><a name="examples">Examples of Biased Sample</a></h4>

  <ol>

  <p><li>Bill is assigned by his editor to determine what most Americans
  think about a new law that will place a federal tax on all modems and
  computers purchased. The revenues from the tax will be used to enforce
  new online decency laws. Bill, being technically inclined, decides to
  use an email poll. In his poll, 95 percent  of those surveyed opposed the tax.
  Bill was quite surprised when 65 percent  of all Americans voted for the taxes.

  <p><li>The United Pacifists of America decide to run a poll to determine
  what Americans think about guns and gun control. Jane is assigned the
  task of setting up the study. To save mailing costs, she includes the
  survey form in the group's newsletter mailing. She is very pleased to
  find out that 95 percent  of those surveyed favor gun control laws and she tells
  her friends that the vast majority of Americans favor gun control laws.

  <p><li>Large scale polls were taken in Florida, California, and Maine
  and it was found that an average of 55 percent  of those polled spent at least 
  fourteen days a year near the ocean. So, it can be safely concluded that
  55 percent  of all Americans spend at least fourteen days near the ocean each
  year.
