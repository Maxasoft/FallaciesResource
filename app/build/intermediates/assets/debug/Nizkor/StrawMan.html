<h3>Fallacy: Straw Man</h3>
<hr />
<h4><a name="description">Description of Straw Man</a></h4>

<p>The Straw Man fallacy is committed when a person simply ignores a
person's actual position and substitutes a distorted, exaggerated or
misrepresented version of that position. This sort of
"reasoning" has the following pattern:

<ol>
<p><li>Person A has position X.
<li>Person B presents position Y (which is a distorted version of X).
<li>Person B attacks position Y.
<li>Therefore X is false/incorrect/flawed.
</ol>

<p>This sort of "reasoning" is fallacious because attacking a
distorted version of a position simply does not constitute an attack on
the position itself. One might as well expect an attack on a poor
drawing of a person to hurt the person.

<h4><a name="examples">Examples of Straw Man</a></h4>

<ol>

<p><li>Prof. Jones: "The university just cut our yearly budget by $10,000."
<br />Prof. Smith: "What are we going to do?"
<br />Prof. Brown: "I think we should eliminate one of the teaching assistant positions. That would take care of it."
<br />Prof. Jones: "We could reduce our scheduled raises instead."
<br />Prof. Brown: " I can't understand why you want to bleed us dry like that, Jones."

<p><li>"Senator Jones says that we should not fund the attack
submarine program. I disagree entirely. I can't understand why he wants
to leave us defenseless like that."

<p><li>Bill and Jill are arguing about cleaning out their closets:
<br />Jill: "We should clean out the closets. They are getting a bit messy."
<br />Bill: "Why, we just went through those closets last year. Do we have to clean them out everyday?"
<br />Jill: "I never said anything about cleaning them out every day. You just want too keep all your junk forever, which is just ridiculous."
