	<h3>Fallacy: Appeal to Ridicule</h3>
	<hr />
	
	<p>Also Known as: Appeal to Mockery, The Horse Laugh.
	
	<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Ridicule</a></h4>
	
	<p>The Appeal to Ridicule is a fallacy in which ridicule or mockery is
	substituted for evidence in an "argument." This line of
	"reasoning" has the following form:
	
	<ol>
	  <li>X, which is some form of ridicule is presented (typically directed at the claim).
	<li>Therefore claim C is false.
	</ol>
	
	<p>This sort of "reasoning" is fallacious because mocking a
	claim does not show that it is false. This is especially clear in the
	following example: "1+1=2! That's the most ridiculous thing I have
	ever heard!"
	
	<p>It should be noted that showing that a claim is ridiculous through
	the use of legitimate methods (such as a non fallacious argument) can
	make it reasonable to reject the claim. One form of this line of
	reasoning is known as a "reductio ad absurdum" ("reducing
	to absurdity"). In this sort of argument, the idea is to show that
	a contradiction (a statement that must be false) or an absurd result
	follows from a claim. For example: "Bill claims that a member of a
	minority group cannot be a racist. However, this is absurd. Think about
	this: white males are a minority in the world. Given Bill's claim, it
	would follow that no white males could be racists. Hence, the Klan,
	Nazis, and white supremists are not racist organizations."
	
	<p>Since the claim that the Klan, Nazis, and white supremists are not
	racist organizations is clearly absurd, it can be concluded that the
	claim that a member of a minority cannot be a racist is false.

	<ol>
	
	<p><li>"Sure my worthy opponent claims that we should lower tuition,
	but that is just laughable."
	
	<p><li>"Support the ERA? Sure, when the women start paying for the
	drinks! Hah! Hah!"
	
	<p><li>"Those wacky conservatives! They think a strong military is the
	key to peace!"
