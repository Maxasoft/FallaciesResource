<h3>personal incredulity</h3>
<h4>Because you found something difficult to understand, or are unaware of how it works, you made out like it's probably not true.</h4>
<p>Complex subjects like biological evolution through natural selection require some amount of understanding of how they work before one is able to properly grasp them; this fallacy is usually used in place of that understanding.</p>
<p><b>Example: Kirk drew a picture of a fish and a human and with effusive disdain asked Richard if he really thought we were stupid enough to believe that a fish somehow turned into a human through just, like, random things happening over time.</b></p>
