<h3>appeal to nature</h3>
<h4>You argued that because something is 'natural' it is therefore valid, justified, inevitable, or better.</h4>
<p>Just because something is natural does not mean that it's good. For instance murder is very natural, but most of us agree that we don't think it's a very good thing to be doing, nor does its 'naturalness' constitute any kind of justification for it.</p>
<p><b>Example: The medicine man rolled into town on his bandwagon offering various natural remedies, such as very special plain water. He said that it was only natural that people should be wary of 'artificial' medicines such as antibiotics.</b></p>
