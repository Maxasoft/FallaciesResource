  <h4><a id="populum" name="populum">Argumentum ad populum</a> (Appeal to the people or gallery)</h4>

  <p>This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People. You commit this fallacy if you attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people. This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Pornography must be banned. It is violence against women."</p>

  <p class="quote">"For thousands of years people have believed in Jesus and the Bible. This belief has had a great impact on their lives. What more evidence do you need that Jesus was the Son of God? Are you trying to tell those people that they are all mistaken fools?"</p>
