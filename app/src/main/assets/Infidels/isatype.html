  <h4><a id="isatype" name="isatype">Undistributed Middle / "A is based on B" fallacies / "... is a type of ..." fallacies</a></h4>

  <p>These fallacies occur if you attempt to argue that things are in some way similar, but you don't actually specify in what way they are similar. Examples:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Isn't history based upon faith? If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of history?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a form of Christianity?"</p>

  <p class="quote">"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?"</p>
