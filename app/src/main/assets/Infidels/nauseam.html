  <h4><a id="nauseam" name="nauseam">Argumentum ad nauseam</a></h4>

  <p>This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true, or is more likely to be accepted as true, the more often it is heard. So an Argumentum ad Nauseam is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something; saying the same thing over and over again until you're sick of hearing it.</p>

  <p>On the Net, your argument is often less likely to be heard if you repeat it over and over again, as people will tend to put you in their kill files.</p>
