  <h4><a id="anecdotal" name="anecdotal">Anecdotal evidence</a></h4>

  <p>One of the simplest fallacies is to rely on anecdotal evidence. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"There's abundant proof that God exists and is still performing miracles today. Just last week I read about a girl who was dying of cancer. Her whole family went to church and prayed for her, and she was cured."</p>

  <p>It's quite valid to use personal experience to illustrate a point; but such anecdotes don't actually prove anything to anyone. Your friend may say he met Elvis in the supermarket, but those who haven't had the same experience will require more than your friend's anecdotal evidence to convince them.</p>

  <p>Anecdotal evidence can seem very compelling, especially if the audience <EM>wants</EM> to believe it. This is part of the explanation for urban legends; stories which are verifiably false have been known to circulate as anecdotes for years.</p>
