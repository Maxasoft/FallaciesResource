  <h4><a id="scots" name="scots">"No True Scotsman ..." fallacy</a></h4>

  <p>Suppose I assert that no Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge. You counter this by pointing out that your friend Angus likes sugar with his porridge. I then say "Ah, yes, but no <EM>true</EM> Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.</p>

  <p>This is an example of an <a href="adhoc.html">ad hoc</a> change being used to shore up an assertion, combined with an attempt to <a href="equivocation.html">shift the meaning of the words</a> used original assertion; you might call it a combination of fallacies.</p>
