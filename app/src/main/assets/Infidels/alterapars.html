  <h4><a id="alterapars" name="alterapars">Audiatur et altera pars</a></h4>

  <p>Often, people will argue from assumptions which they don't bother to state. The principle of Audiatur et Altera Pars is that all of the premises of an argument should be stated explicitly. It's not strictly a fallacy to fail to state all of your assumptions; however, it's often viewed with suspicion.</p>
