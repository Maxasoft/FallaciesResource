  <h4><a id="posthoc" name="posthoc">Post hoc ergo propter hoc</a></h4>

  <p>The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before that event. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"The Soviet Union collapsed after instituting state atheism. Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons."</p>

  <p>This is another type of <a href="noncausa.html">false cause fallacy</a>.</p>
