  <h4><a id="numerum" name="numerum">Argumentum ad numerum</a></h4>

  <p>This fallacy is closely related to the <a href="populum.html">argumentum ad populum</a>. It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"The vast majority of people in this country believe that capital punishment has a noticeable deterrent effect. To suggest that it doesn't in the face of so much evidence is ridiculous."</p>

  <p class="quote">"All I'm saying is that thousands of people believe in pyramid power, so there must be something to it."</p>
