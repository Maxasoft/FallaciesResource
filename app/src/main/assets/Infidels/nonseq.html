  <h4><a id="nonseq" name="nonseq">Non sequitur</a></h4>

  <p>A non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which aren't logically connected with it. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Since Egyptians did so much excavation to construct the pyramids, they were well versed in paleontology."</p>

  <p>(Non sequiturs are an important ingredient in a lot of humor. They're still fallacies, though.)</p>
