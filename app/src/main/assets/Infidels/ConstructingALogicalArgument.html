	<h3>Constructing a Logical Argument</h3>
	<hr>
	
	  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	
	  <p>There is a lot of debate on the net. Unfortunately, much of it is of very low quality. The aim of this document is to explain the basics of logical reasoning, and hopefully improve the overall quality of debate.</p>
	
	  <p>The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines logic as "the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference." Logic will let you analyze an argument or a piece of reasoning, and work out whether it is likely to be correct or not. You don't need to know logic to argue, of course; but if you know even a little, you'll find it easier to spot invalid arguments.</p>
	
	  <p>There are many kinds of logic, such as fuzzy logic and constructive logic; they have different rules, and different strengths and weaknesses. This document discusses simple Boolean logic, because it's commonplace and relatively easy to understand. When people talk about something being "logical," they usually mean the type of logic described here.</p><a id="isnot" name="isnot"></a>
	
	  <h3>What logic isn't</h3>
	
	  <p>It's worth mentioning a couple of things which logic is not.</p>
	
	  <p>First, <STRONG>logical reasoning is not an absolute law which governs the universe</STRONG>. Many times in the past, people have concluded that because something is logically impossible (given the science of the day), it must be impossible, period. It was also believed at one time that Euclidean geometry was a universal law; it is, after all, logically consistent. Again, we now know that the rules of Euclidean geometry are not universal.</p>
	
	  <p>Second, <STRONG>logic is not a set of rules which govern human behavior</STRONG>. Humans may have logically conflicting goals. For example:</p>
	
	  <ul>
	    <li>John wishes to speak to whoever is in charge.</LI>
	
	    <li>The person in charge is Steve.</LI>
	
	    <li>Therefore John wishes to speak to Steve.</LI>
	  </ul>
	
	  <p>Unfortunately, John may have a conflicting goal of avoiding Steve, meaning that the reasoned answer may be inapplicable to real life.</p>
	
	  <p>This document only explains how to use logic; you must decide whether logic is the right tool for the job. There are other ways to communicate, discuss and debate.</p>
	
	  <h3>Arguments</h3>
	
	  <p>An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, "a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition."</p>
	
	  <p>Many types of argument exist; we will discuss the <dfn>deductive argument</dfn>. Deductive arguments are generally viewed as the most precise and the most persuasive; they provide conclusive proof of their conclusion, and are either <dfn>valid</dfn> or <dfn>invalid</dfn>.</p>
	
	  <p>Deductive arguments have three stages:</p>
	
	  <ol>
	    <li>premises</LI>
	
	    <li>inference</LI>
	
	    <li>conclusion</LI>
	  </ol>
	
	  <p>However, before we can consider those stages in detail, we must discuss the building blocks of a deductive argument: propositions.</p>
	
	  <h3>Propositions</h3>
	
	  <p>A <dfn>proposition</dfn> is a statement which is either true or false. The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the precise arrangement of words used to convey that meaning.</p>
	
	  <p>For example, "There exists an even prime number greater than two" is a proposition. (A false one, in this case.) "An even prime number greater than two exists" is the same proposition, reworded.</p>
	
	  <p>Unfortunately, it's very easy to unintentionally change the meaning of a statement by rephrasing it. It's generally safer to consider the wording of a proposition as significant.</p>
	
	  <p>It's possible to use formal linguistics to analyze and rephrase a statement without changing its meaning; but how to do so is outside the scope of this document.</p>
	
	  <h3>Premises</h3>
	
	  <p>A deductive argument always requires a number of core assumptions. These are called <dfn>premises</dfn>, and are the assumptions the argument is built on; or to look at it another way, the reasons for accepting the argument. Premises are only premises in the context of a particular argument; they might be conclusions in other arguments, for example.</p>
	
	  <p>You should always state the premises of the argument explicitly; this is the principle of <I>audiatur et altera pars.</I> Failing to state your assumptions is often viewed as suspicious, and will likely reduce the acceptance of your argument.</p>
	
	  <p>The premises of an argument are often introduced with words such as "Assume," "Since," "Obviously," and "Because." It's a good idea to get your opponent to agree with the premises of your argument before proceeding any further.</p>
	
	  <p>The word "obviously" is also often viewed with suspicion. It occasionally gets used to persuade people to accept false statements, rather than admit that they don't understand why something is "obvious." So don't be afraid to question statements which people tell you are "obvious"--when you've heard the explanation you can always say something like "You're right, now that I think about it that way, it <EM>is</EM> obvious."</p>
	
	  <h3>Inference</h3>
	
	  <p>Once the premises have been agreed, the argument proceeds via a step-by-step process called <dfn>inference</dfn>.</p>
	
	  <p>In inference, you start with one or more propositions which have been accepted; you then use those propositions to arrive at a new proposition. If the inference is valid, that proposition should also be accepted. You can use the new proposition for inference later on.</p>
	
	  <p>So initially, you can only infer things from the premises of the argument. But as the argument proceeds, the number of statements available for inference increases.</p>
	
	  <p>There are various kinds of valid inference--and also some invalid kinds, which we'll look at later on. Inference steps are often identified by phrases like "therefore ..." or "... implies that ..."</p>
	
	  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
	
	  <p>Hopefully you will arrive at a proposition which is the conclusion of the argument - the result you are trying to prove. The conclusion is the result of the final step of inference. It's only a conclusion in the context of a particular argument; it could be a premise or assumption in another argument.</p>
	
	  <p>The conclusion is said to be <dfn>affirmed</dfn> on the basis of the premises, and the inference from them. This is a subtle point which deserves further explanation.</p>
	
	  <h3>Implication in detail</h3>
	
	  <p>Clearly you can build a valid argument from true premises, and arrive at a true conclusion. You can also build a valid argument from false premises, and arrive at a false conclusion.</p>
	
	  <p>The tricky part is that you can start with false premises, proceed via valid inference, and reach a <EM>true</EM> conclusion. For example:</p>
	
	  <ul>
	    <li>Premise: All fish live in the ocean</LI>
	
	    <li>Premise: Sea otters are fish</LI>
	
	    <li>Conclusion: Therefore sea otters live in the ocean</LI>
	  </ul>
	
	  <p>There's one thing you can't do, though: start from true premises, proceed via valid deductive inference, and reach a false conclusion.</p>
	
	  <p>We can summarize these results as a "<a id="truthtable" name="truthtable">truth table</a>" for implication. The symbol "=>" denotes implication; "A" is the premise, "B" the conclusion. "T" and "F" represent true and false respectively.</p>
	
	  <!-- <table border="1" cellpadding="3" style="color:white;text-align:center"> -->
	  <table>
	    <caption>
	      Truth Table for Implication
	    </caption>
	
	    <tr>
	      <th>Premise</th>
	
	      <th>Conclusion</th>
	
	      <th>Inference</th>
	    </tr>
	
	    <tr>
	      <th>A</th>
	
	      <th>B</th>
	
	      <th>A => B</th>
	    </tr>
	
	    <tr>
	      <td align="center">false</td>
	
	      <td align="center">false</td>
	
	      <td align="center">true</td>
	    </tr>
	
	    <tr>
	      <td align="center">false</td>
	
	      <td align="center">true</td>
	
	      <td align="center">true</td>
	    </tr>
	
	    <tr>
	      <td align="center">true</td>
	
	      <td align="center">false</td>
	
	      <td align="center">false</td>
	    </tr>
	
	    <tr>
	      <td align="center">true</td>
	
	      <td align="center">true</td>
	
	      <td align="center">true</td>
	    </tr>
	  </table>
	
	  <ul>
	    <li>If the premises are false and the inference valid, the conclusion can be true or false. (Lines 1 and 2.)</LI>
	
	    <li>If the premises are true and the conclusion false, the inference must be invalid. (Line 3.)</LI>
	
	    <li>If the premises are true and the inference valid, the conclusion must be true. (Line 4.)</LI>
	  </ul>
	
	  <p>So <EM>the fact that an argument is valid doesn't necessarily mean that its conclusion holds</EM>--it may have started from false premises.</p>
	
	  <p>If an argument is valid, and in addition it started from true premises, then it is called a <dfn>sound</dfn> argument. A sound argument must arrive at a true conclusion.</p>
	
	  <h3>Example argument</h3>
	
	  <p>Here's an example of an argument which is valid, and which may or may not be sound:</p>
	
	  <ol>
	    <li>Premise: Every event has a cause</LI>
	
	    <li>Premise: The universe has a beginning</LI>
	
	    <li>Premise: All beginnings involve an event</LI>
	
	    <li>Inference: This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event</LI>
	
	    <li>Inference: Therefore the beginning of the universe had a cause</LI>
	
	    <li>Conclusion: The universe had a cause</LI>
	  </ol>
	
	  <p>The proposition in line 4 is inferred from lines 2 and 3. Line 1 is then used, with the proposition derived in line 4, to infer a new proposition in line 5. The result of the inference in line 5 is then restated (in slightly simplified form) as the conclusion.</p>
	
	  <h3>Spotting arguments</h3>
	
	  <p>Spotting an argument is harder than spotting premises or a conclusion. Lots of people shower their writing with assertions, without ever producing anything you might reasonably call an argument.</p>
	
	  <p>Sometimes arguments don't follow the pattern described above. For example, people may state their conclusions first, and then justify them afterwards. This is valid, but it can be a little confusing.</p>
	
	  <p>To make the situation worse, some statements look like arguments but aren't. For example:</p>
	
	  <p class="quote">"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, a liar, or the Son of God."</p>
	
	  <p>That's not an argument; it's a conditional statement. It doesn't state the premises necessary to support its conclusion, and even if you add those assertions it suffers from a number of other flaws which are described in more detail in the <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mathew/arguments.html#lll">Atheist Arguments</a> document.</p>
	
	  <p>An argument is also not the same as an explanation. Suppose that you are trying to argue that Albert Einstein believed in God, and say:</p>
	
	  <p class="quote">"Einstein made his famous statement 'God does not play dice' because of his belief in God."</p>
	
	  <p>That may look like a relevant argument, but it's not; it's an explanation of Einstein's statement. To see this, remember that a statement of the form "X because Y" can be rephrased as an equivalent statement, of the form "Y therefore X." Doing so gives us:</p>
	
	  <p class="quote">"Einstein believed in God, therefore he made his famous statement 'God does not play dice.'"</p>
	
	  <p>Now it's clear that the statement, which looked like an argument, is actually assuming the result which it is supposed to be proving, in order to explain the Einstein quote.</p>
	
	  <p>Furthermore, Einstein did not believe in a personal God concerned with human affairs--again, see the <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/mathew/arguments.html#einstein">Atheist Arguments</a> document.</p>
	
	  <p>We've outlined the structure of a sound deductive argument, from premises to conclusion. But ultimately, the conclusion of a valid logical argument is only as compelling as the premises you started from. Logic in itself doesn't solve the problem of verifying the basic assertions which support arguments; for that, we need some other tool. The dominant means of verifying basic assertions is scientific enquiry. However, the philosophy of science and the scientific method are huge topics which are quite beyond the scope of this document.</p>

	  <h3><a id="fallacies" name="fallacies">Fallacies</a></h3>
	
	  <p>There are a number of common pitfalls to avoid when constructing a deductive argument; they're known as <dfn>fallacies</dfn>. In everyday English, we refer to many kinds of mistaken beliefs as fallacies; but in logic, the term has a more specific meaning: a fallacy is a technical flaw which makes an argument unsound or invalid.</p>
	
	  <p>(Note that you can criticize more than just the soundness of an argument. Arguments are almost always presented with some specific purpose in mind--and the intent of the argument may also be worthy of criticism.)</p>
	
	  <p>Arguments which contain fallacies are described as <dfn>fallacious</dfn>. They often appear valid and convincing; sometimes only close inspection reveals the logical flaw.</p>
