 <h4><a id="accent" name="accent">Accent</a></h4>

  <p>Accent is a form of fallacy through shifting meaning. In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"We should not speak <STRONG>ill</STRONG> of our friends"</p>

  <p>and</p>

  <p class="quote">"We should not speak ill of our <STRONG>friends</STRONG>"</p>

  <p>Be particularly wary of this fallacy on the net, where it's easy to misread the emphasis of what's written.</p>
