  <h4><a id="cumhoc" name="cumhoc">Cum hoc ergo propter hoc</a></h4>

  <p>This fallacy is similar to <a href="posthoc.html">post hoc ergo propter hoc</a>. The fallacy is to assert that because two events occur together, they must be causally related. It's a fallacy because it ignores other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.</p>

  <p class="quote">"Literacy rates have steadily declined since the advent of television. Clearly television viewing impedes learning."</p>

  <p>This fallacy is a special case of the more general <a href="noncausa.html">non causa pro causa</a>.</p>
