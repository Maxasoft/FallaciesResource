  <h4><a id="authority" name="authority">Argumentum ad verecundiam</a> (Appeal to authority)</h4>

  <p>The Appeal to Authority uses admiration of a famous person to try and win support for an assertion. For example:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God."</p>

  <p>This line of argument isn't always completely bogus when used in an inductive argument; for example, it may be relevant to refer to a widely-regarded authority in a particular field, if you're discussing that subject. For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation"</p>

  <p>and</p>

  <p class="quote">"Penrose has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer"</p>

  <p>Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed. Penrose is a mathematician, so it is questionable whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.</p>
