<h3>the fallacy fallacy</h3>
<h4>Presuming that because a claim has been poorly argued, or a fallacy has been made, that it is necessarily wrong.</h4>
<p>There are few things more frustrating than watching someone poorly argue a position one holds. Much of the time a debate is won not because the victor is right, but because s/he is better at debating than their opponent. If we're to be honest and rational, we must be mindful that just because someone made a mistake in their defence of an argument, it doesn't necessarily follow that the argument itself is wrong.</p>
<p><b>Example: Recognising that Amanda had committed a fallacy in arguing that we should eat healthy food because it was popular, Alyse resolved to eat bacon double cheeseburgers every day.</b></p>
