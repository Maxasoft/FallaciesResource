<h3>ambiguity</h3>
<h4>You used a double meaning or ambiguity of language to mislead or misrepresent the truth.</h4>
<p>Politicians are often guilty of using ambiguity to mislead and will later point to how they were technically not outright lying if they come under scrutiny. The reason that it qualifies as a fallacy is that it is intrinsically misleading.</p>
<p><b>Example: When the judge asked the defendant why he hadn't paid his parking fines, he said that he shouldn't have to pay them because the sign said 'Fine for parking here' and so he naturally presumed that it would be fine to park there.</b></p>
