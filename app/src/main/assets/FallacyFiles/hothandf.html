    <strong>Type:</strong> <a href="probfall.html">Probabilistic Fallacy</a>
    <h3>
      Form:</h3>
    <p>
      A gambler has had a streak of luck.
      <br />
      Therefore, the gambler is either "hot" or "cold", depending on whether the luck
      is good or bad, and the good or bad luck will continue at a probability greater
      than chance.
      <h3>
        Exposition:</h3>
      <p>
        This fallacy is committed every day in casinos around the world, whenever a gambler
        thinks he's "hot". When gamblers are on winning streaks, and keep betting or increase
        their wagers to take advantage of their good luck, they commit this fallacy. The
        fundamental mistake is the same as in the gambler's fallacy, that is, the failure
        to appreciate statistical independence. Just as a fair gambling device does not
        remember its own past, it also does not remember a gambler's past. So, a gambler's
        odds of winning a current bet are not affected by whether the gambler has won previous
        bets.
        <p>
          Despite it's name, gamblers also commit this fallacy when they think that they're
          "cold", and stop betting or decrease their wagers because they're on a losing streak.
          This is still the "hot hand" fallacy, because the logical mistake is the same: failing
          to appreciate the fact that a random event is not affected by past wins or losses.
          <h3>
            Exposure:</h3>
          <p>
            Ironically, the gambler's and hot hand fallacies can lead to <a href="glossary.html#ContraryProps">
              contrary</a> expectations about what will happen next: Suppose that a gambler
            bets on his lucky number, and wins several times in a row. The gambler's fallacy
            predicts that his lucky number will be less likely than chance to come up on the
            next bet, but the hot hand fallacy predicts that the lucky number is more likely
            to come up. This means that <em>both</em> predictions cannot be true, despite the
            fact that many gamblers probably have committed both fallacies, even on the same
            day, though not at the same time. So, these two forms of <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
              argument</a> cannot both be <a href="glossary.html#Cogent">cogent</a>, and in
            fact both are <em>un</em>cogent.
