    Fallacy of Modal Logic</h1>
  <strong>Type:</strong> <a href="formfall.html">Formal Fallacy</a>
  <h3>
    Exposition:</h3>
  <p>
    Modal logic is that branch of logic which studies logical relations involving modalities.
    Modalities are ways, so to speak, in which <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">proposition</a>s
    can be true or false. The most commonly studied modalities are necessity and possibility,
    which are modalities because some propositions are necessarily true/false and others
    are possibly true/false. Types of modality include:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Alethic Modalities:</strong> These include possibility and necessity,
        which were already mentioned, as well as impossibility and contingency. Some propositions
        are impossible, that is, necessarily false, whereas others are contingent, meaning
        that they are both possibly true and possibly false.
        <li><strong>Temporal Modalities:</strong> Historical and future truth or falsity.
          Some propositions were true/false in the past and others will be true/false in the
          future.
          <li><strong>Deontic Modalities:</strong> Obligation and permissibility. Some propositions
            ought to be true/false, while others are permissible.
            <li><strong>Epistemic Modalities:</strong>
      Knowledge and belief. Some propositions are known to be true/false, and others are
      believed to be true/false.</ul>
    <p>
      Most modalities are propositional functions&#8213;that is, they are functions which
      when applied to a proposition produce a proposition&#8213;like <a href="glossary.html#Negation">
        negation</a>, but unlike negation in that they are not <a href="glossary.html#TruthFunctional">
          truth-functional</a>. That is, you cannot determine the <a href="glossary.html#TruthValue">
            truth-value</a> of a modal proposition based solely upon the truth-value of
      the proposition it contains. For instance, from the fact that a certain proposition
      is true it does not follow that it is necessarily true, nor that it isn't. Some
      true propositions are necessary, but others are not.
      <p>
        Modal fallacies are formal fallacies in which modality plays a role in the <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">
          fallacious</a>ness of a type of <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>.
        <h3>
          Exposure:</h3>
        <p>
          Since modalities are frequent topics in philosophy&#8213;alethic modalities in metaphysics,
          epistemic ones in epistemology, and deontic ones in ethics&#8213;modal fallacies
          are quite frequent in philosophical and pseudo-philosophical argumentation. So,
          while students of philosophy should, of course, study logic and fallacies in general,
          they should pay particular attention to modal fallacies including the <a href="glossary.html#Subfallacy">
            subfallacy</a> below.
