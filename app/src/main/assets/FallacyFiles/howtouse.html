    How to Use the Taxonomy</h1>
  <p>
    <a href="taxonomy.html">The Taxonomy of Logical Fallacies</a>
    <p>
      Beginning with Aristotle, the first logician to name fallacies, most logicians who
      have studied fallacies have classified them into <em>types</em>. Aristotle classified
      his list of fallacies into two types:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Linguistic:</strong> Those which depend on language.
          <li><strong>Non-linguistic:</strong>
        Those which do not depend on language.</ul>
      <p>
        Subsequent logicians have usually extended Aristotle's classification by subdividing
        the second, non-linguistic, category into, for instance, fallacies of relevance
        and fallacies of presumption. However, most such classifications have remained relatively
        "flat", with all fallacies on the same level, but a flat classification does not
        do justice to the complexity of the logical relations between different fallacies.
        <p>
          The Taxonomy is a tree-like structure that classifies all of the fallacies in these
          files by the <a href="glossary.html#Subfallacy"><em>subfallacy</em></a> relation.
          A subfallacy, which is a specific version of a more general fallacy, has whatever
          features the more general fallacy has, together with specific features which set
          it apart and make it worth naming in its own right. For example, instead of grouping
          together "fallacies of relevance", there is one most general such fallacy&#151namely,
          Red Herring&#151and all fallacies of relevance are subfallacies of it. Red Herring
          is itself a subfallacy of Informal Fallacy, which is a subfallacy of the most general
          logical fallacy of all: Logical Fallacy. Logical Fallacy is, thus, the top node
          of the Taxonomy, for every fallacy in the Taxonomy is a subfallacy of it. The subfallacy
          relationship is like a tree with a trunk&#8213;Logical Fallacy&#8213;which branches
          until it reaches leaves, that is, fallacies which have no subfallacies&#8213;for
          example, Appeal to Celebrity. In the Taxonomy as pictured, the tree is lying on
          its side with the trunk to the left and the leaves to the right, connected by black
          branches which represent the subfallacy relation.
          <p>
            The Taxonomy uses the following color-coding: The most general fallacy, Logical
            Fallacy, is white. Its immediate subfallacies split into the red, blue, and green
            colors that constitute white light. Formal fallacies are colored red, and informal
            ones blue. This color scheme is entirely arbitrary and has no meaning itself, except
            to visually distinguish the types of fallacy&#8213;in fact, it has the consequence
            that the informal fallacy Red Herring is blue! The odd man out is Loaded Question,
            which is colored green. Also, the colors fade, becoming more muted as one proceeds
            from more general fallacies on the left to more specific ones on the right.
            <p>
              Some fallacies&#8213;such as Ambiguous Middle&#8213;are purple or violet&#8213;that
              is, a blend of red and blue&#8213;because they have both formal and informal aspects
              and are, therefore, subfallacies of both Formal and Informal Fallacy. This means,
              of course, that formal and informal are not <a href="glossary.html#Disjoint" title="Having no common member.">
                disjoint</a> categories, as one might expect. This is because the fallacies in
              common to both categories have a formal and a linguistic dimension. For instance,
              Ambiguous Middle is a type of Four-Term Fallacy, thus violating the formal rules
              of <a href="glossary.html#CategoricalSyll" title="A syllogism whose premisses and conclusion are categorical propositions.">
                categorical syllogism</a>s; but it is also a type of Equivocation, an informal
              fallacy, since a single word stands for two of the four terms.
              <p>
                The Taxonomy is more useful than the alphabetical index for studying the logical
                relationships between fallacies. To understand an individual fallacy, it may be
                helpful to move upward in the Taxonomy&#8213;that is, to the left&#8213;in order
                to understand the more general fallacy of which it is a subfallacy. Also, moving
                downward&#8213;that is, to the right&#8213;can help in understanding a general fallacy
                through seeing more specific versions of it. Some individual fallacies&#8213;such
                as Wishful Thinking&#8213;are leaves on more than one branch of the Taxonomy, because
                they are subfallacies of more than one type of fallacy.
                <p>
                  In addition, fallacies that are subfallacies of the same general fallacy are like
                  siblings, since they share the same parent. So, it may help to compare and contrast
                  a fallacy with its siblings. As with human siblings, the likeness between sibling
                  fallacies is stronger in some cases than in others. For instance, the causal fallacies
                  Post Hoc and Cum Hoc are more similar to each other than they are to their other
                  siblings, the Regression and Texas Sharpshooter fallacies. In the Taxonomy, this
                  strong sibling relationship is indicated by a thicker, similarly-colored line connecting
                  the two fallacies.
                  <p>
                    Another use for the Taxonomy is in finding a fallacy whose name you do not know,
                    but you do know what general type of mistake you are looking for. Start with a general
                    fallacy, and "drill down" into the Taxonomy&#8213;that is, moving to the right&#8213;until
                    you find what you're looking for.
