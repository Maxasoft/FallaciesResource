          A <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">proposition</a> has <em>existential import</em>
          if it implies that some class is not empty, that is, that there is at least one
          member of the class. For example:

            To reason from premisses that lack existential import for a certain class to a conclusion

              History:</h3>
            <p>
              In the traditional formal logic developed by Aristotle and subsequent logicians
              through the Middle Ages, it was implicitly assumed that the classes of things referred
              to by the subject and predicate <a href="glossary.html#Term">term</a>s of <a href="glossary.html#CategoricalProp">
                categorical proposition</a>s were non-empty. For this reason, certain arguments
              were considered valid which would not be valid if some class were empty. For example,
              an <a href="glossary.html#Aproposition"><strong>A</strong>-type proposition</a>
              implies an <a href="glossary.html#Iproposition"><strong>I</strong>-type</a>, and
              an <a href="glossary.html#Eproposition"><strong>E</strong>-type</a> implies an <a
                href="glossary.html#Oproposition"><strong>O</strong>-type</a>:
              <table height="15" width="400" cellpadding="10" align="center">
                <caption>
                  Subalternation</caption>
                <tr>
                  <td>
                    All Catholics are christians.
                    <br />
                    Therefore, some christians are Catholics.
                  </td>
                  <td>
                    No atheists are christians.
                    <br />
                    Therefore, some christians are not atheists.
                  </td>
                </tr>
              </table>
              <p>
                This type of inference is called "subalternation". Unfortunately, subalternation
                is an invalid form of argument if one of the terms refers to an empty class, such
                as "unicorns"; see the <strong>Counter-Example</strong>.
                <p>
                  For reasons explained in the Exposure, logicians of the nineteenth century dropped
                  the traditional assumption of non-emptiness, and adopted what is called the "Boolean
                  interpretation"&#151after logician George Boole&#151of <a href="glossary.html#UniversalQuant">
                    universal quantifiers</a>. Under the Boolean interpretation, <strong>A</strong>-
                  and <strong>E</strong>-type propositions lack existential import, while both <strong>
                    I</strong>- and <strong>O</strong>-type have it. This has the consequence that
                  some <a href="glossary.html#ImmediateInference">immediate inference</a>s&#151such
                  as subalternation&#151and <a href="glossary.html#CategoricalSyll">categorical syllogism</a>s
                  which were valid under the traditional interpretation become instances of the Existential
                  Fallacy. Of course, as long as the relevant classes are known to be non-empty, an
                  argument should be considered to be an <a href="glossary.html#Enthymeme">enthymeme</a>
                  instead of an instance of this fallacy.
                  <h3>
                    Exposure:</h3>
                  <p>
                    The traditional theory makes it impossible to reason about empty classes, which
                    might seem to be a small price to pay if all that we had to give up were classes
                    such as unicorns. However, some classes may be empty for all we know, yet we manage
                    to reason about them all the same. For instance, there may be no extraterrestrial
                    aliens, but we cannot even say this meaningfully in the traditional theory, let
                    alone use the class in an argument.
                    <img src="Shoplift.gif" alt="Shoplifters Will Be Prosecuted" border="0">
                    <p>
                      Also, consider a shopkeeper who puts up the following sign:
                      <p>
                        The shopkeeper hopes that potential thieves will reason as follows:
                        <blockquote>
                          According to the sign, if I shoplift, I'll be prosecuted. I don't want to be prosecuted.
                          Therefore, I'd better not shoplift in this store.</blockquote>
                        <p>
                          According to the traditional theory, if the sign succeeds in deterring shoplifters,
                          then they cannot reason this way! Yet, it is partly <em>because</em> people reason
                          this way that there are no shoplifters.
