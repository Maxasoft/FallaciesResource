  <h3>
    Exposure:</h3>
  <p>
    There is an important linguistic caveat to the application of this fallacy, namely,
    that it is common mathematical practise to state definitions as <a href="glossary.html#ConditionalProp">
      conditional proposition</a>s, rather than <a href="glossary.html#BiconditionalProp">
        <em>bi</em>conditional proposition</a>s. For instance:
    <blockquote>
      A vector space <strong>V</strong> is <em>finite-dimensional</em> if it has a finite
      basis.</blockquote>
    <p>
      It would not be mistaken to infer from this definition that if a vector space is
      finite-dimensional then it has a finite basis.
      <h3>
        History:</h3>
      <p>
        This is one of Aristotle's thirteen fallacies, from the language-independent group,
        also known as the "Fallacy of the Consequent". The closely-related Fallacy of <a
          href="afthecon.html">Affirming the Consequent</a> is often attributed to Aristotle,
        but his description of the fallacy sounds closer to <a href="glossary.html#Commuting">
          commuting</a> a conditional than affirming its <a href="glossary.html#Consequent">
            consequent</a>:
        <blockquote>
          The refutation which depends upon the consequent arises because people suppose that
          the relation of consequence is convertible. For whenever, suppose <strong>A</strong>
          is, <strong>B</strong> necessarily is, they then suppose also that if <strong>B</strong>
          is, <strong>A</strong> necessarily is. This is also the source of the deceptions
          that attend opinions based on sense-perception. For people often suppose bile to
          be honey because honey is attended by a yellow colour: also, since after rain the
          ground is wet in consequence, we suppose that if the ground is wet, it has been
          raining; whereas that does not necessarily follow.</blockquote>
