    <blockquote>
      Unfortunately, it does not go without saying that in our examination we must avoid
      the fallacy that in the last decades has frequently been used as a substitute for
      the <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>: the <em>reductio ad Hitlerum</em>. A view is
      not refuted by the fact that it happens to have been shared by Hitler.</blockquote>

            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            In almost every heated debate, one side or the other&#151often both&#151plays the
            "Hitler card", that is, criticizes their opponent's position by associating it in
            some way with Adolf Hitler or the Nazis in general. This move is so common that
            it led Mike Godwin to develop the well-known "Godwin's Law of Nazi Analogies": "As
            an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis
            or Hitler approaches one."
            <p>
              No one wants to be associated with Nazism because it has been so thoroughly discredited
              in both theory and practise, and Hitler of course was its most famous exponent.
              So, linking an idea with Hitler or Nazism has become a common form of <a href="glossary.html#Argument"
                title="A unit of reasoning.">argument</a> ascribing guilt by association.
              <p>
                Some instances of the Hitler card are factually incorrect, or even ludicrous, in
                ascribing ideas to Hitler or other Nazis that they did not hold. However, from a
                logical point of view, even if Hitler or other Nazis did accept an idea, this historical
                fact alone is insufficient to discredit it.
                <p>
                  The Hitler Card is often combined with other fallacies, for instance, a weak analogy
                  between an opponent and Hitler, or between the opposition political group and the
                  Nazis. A related form of <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious" title="Committing a logical fallacy.">
                    fallacious</a> analogy is that which compares an opposition's actions with the
                  Holocaust. This is a form of the ad Nazium fallacy because it casts the opposition
                  in the role of Nazi. Not only do such arguments assign guilt by association, but
                  the analogy used to link the opposition's actions with the Holocaust may be superficial
                  or question-begging.
                  <p>
                    Other arguments ad Nazium combine guilt by association with a slippery slope. For
                    instance, it is sometimes argued that the Nazis practised euthanasia, and therefore
                    even voluntary forms of it are a first step onto a slippery slope leading to extermination
                    camps. Like many slippery slope arguments, this is a way of avoiding arguing directly
                    against voluntary euthanasia, instead claiming that it may indirectly lead to something
                    admittedly bad.
                    <p>
                      Playing the Hitler Card demonizes opponents in debate by associating them with evil,
                      and almost always derails the discussion. People naturally resent being associated
                      with Nazism, and are usually angered. In this way, playing the Hitler Card can be
                      an effective distraction in a debate, causing the opponent to lose track of the
                      argument. However, when people become convinced by guilt by association arguments
                      that their political opponents are not just mistaken, but are as evil as Nazis,
                      reasoned debate can give way to violence. So, playing the Hitler Card is more than
                      just a dirty trick in debate, it is often "fighting words".

                        Exposure:</h3>
                      <p>
                        Germany today bans capital punishment, but the history of this ban is surprising:
                        The government of the former West Germany adopted the ban in 1949 and it continues
                        in effect today in the reunited Germany. The law that banned the death penalty was
                        proposed by a politician sympathetic to the Nazi war criminals who were being executed
                        after World War 2, and was intended to block such executions. Should the disreputable
                        historical origins of the ban influence those Germans who today oppose capital punishment
                        to reconsider their views? Should the ban be repealed simply because it was the
                        brainchild of a Nazi sympathizer? Capital punishment is either right or wrong. If
                        it is right, then the ban should be repealed, regardless of its origins; if it's
                        wrong, then the ban should be continued, despite its origins. While the history
                        of the origins of Germany's ban on capital punishment is interesting, it is irrelevant
                        to the moral and legal question of whether the ban should continue. Those Germans
                        who support capital punishment should resist the temptation to play the Hitler card.
