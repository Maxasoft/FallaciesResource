  <blockquote>
    &#133[I]f once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little
    of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and
    from that to incivility and procrastination. Once begin upon this downward path,
    you never know where you are to stop. Many a man has dated his ruin from some murder
    or other that perhaps he thought little of at the time.</blockquote>

    <p>
      There are two types of fallacy referred to as "slippery slopes":

              If <strong>A</strong> happens, then by a gradual series of small steps through <strong>
                B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>,&#133, <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong>,
              eventually <strong>Z</strong> will happen, too.
              <br />
              <strong>Z</strong> should not happen.
              <br />
              Therefore, <strong>A</strong> should not happen, either.

                Example:</h3>
              <blockquote>
                If today you can take a thing like evolution and make it a crime to teach it in
                the public school, tomorrow you can make it a crime to teach it in the private schools,
                and the next year you can make it a crime to teach it to the hustings or in the
                church. At the next session you may ban books and the newspapers. Soon you may set
                Catholic against Protestant and Protestant against Protestant, and try to foist
                your own religion upon the minds of men. If you can do one you can do the other.
                Ignorance and fanaticism is ever busy and needs feeding. Always it is feeding and
                gloating for more. Today it is the public school teachers, tomorrow the private.
                The next day the preachers and the lectures, the magazines, the books, the newspapers.
                After [a]while, your honor, it is the setting of man against man and creed against
                creed until with flying banners and beating drums we are marching backward to the
                glorious ages of the sixteenth century when bigots lighted fagots to burn the men
                who dared to bring any intelligence and enlightenment and culture to the human mind.</blockquote>

                    This type is based upon the claim that a controversial type of action will lead
                    inevitably to some admittedly bad type of action. It is the slide from <strong>A</strong>
                    to <strong>Z</strong> via the intermediate steps <strong>B</strong> through <strong>
                      Y</strong> that is the "slope", and the smallness of each step that makes it "slippery".

                      is inversely proportional to the number of steps between <strong>A</strong> and
                      <strong>Z</strong>, and directly proportional to the causal strength of the connections
                      between adjacent steps. If there are many intervening steps, and the causal connections
                      between them are weak, or even unknown, then the resulting argument will be very
                      weak, if not downright fallacious.

                            This type plays upon the <a href="glossary.html#Vagueness">vagueness</a> of the
                            distinction between two <a href="glossary.html#Term">term</a>s that lie on a continuum.
                            For instance, the concepts of "bald" and "hairy" lie at opposite ends of a spectrum
                            of hairiness. This continuum is the "slope", and it is the lack of a non-arbitrary
                            line between hairiness and baldness that makes it "slippery". We could, of course,
                            decide to count, say, 10,000 hairs or less as the definition of "bald", but this
                            would be arbitrary. Why not 10,001 or 9,999? Obviously, no answer can be given other
                            than the fact that we prefer round numbers. However, a "round" number is one whose
                            numeral ends in one or more zeroes, but this depends upon what base is used in the
                            numbering system. For example, 32 is not round in the decimal (base 10) system,
                            but is round in binary and hexadecimal (base 16). However, what base we use is a
                            matter of convenience.
                            <p>
                              It does not follow from the fact that there is no sharp, non-arbitrary line between
                              "bald" and "hairy" that there really is no difference between the two. A difference
                              in degree is still a difference, and a big enough difference in degree can amount
                              to a difference in kind. For instance, according to the theory of evolution, the
                              difference between species is a difference in degree.
                              <p>
        Similarly, the lack of a bright line between contrary concepts does not mean that
        one of the concepts is a myth&#8213;that is, there is nothing to which it refers.
        For example, some people have argued that there is no such thing as life, since
        the line between animate and inanimate thing is fuzzy. However, we can all easily
        identify many living things and nonliving things, and the fact that there are some
        things which fall into a gray area&#8213;viruses, for instance&#8213;does not mean
        that the concept of life is without reference.</ol>
      <p>
        Though these two fallacies are distinct, and the fact that they share a name is
        unfortunate, they often have a relationship which may justify treating them together:
        semantic slippery slopes often form a basis for causal slippery slopes. In other
        words, people often think that a causal slide from <strong>A</strong> to <strong>Z</strong>
        is unavoidable because there is no precise, non-arbitrary dividing line between
        the two concepts. For instance, opponents of abortion often believe that the legality
        of abortion will lead causally to the legality of infanticide, and one reason for
        this belief is that the only precise dividing line between an embryo and a newborn
        baby is the morally arbitrary one of birth. For this reason, causal slippery slopes
        are often the result of semantic ones.
        <h3>
          Exposure:</h3>
        <p>
          A great deal of ink has been spilled in fruitless philosophical debates over exactly
          where to draw the line between concepts that lie on continua. This might be called
          the "legalistic" side of philosophy, for it is primarily in the law that we are
          forced to decide hard cases that lie in gray areas. For instance, if the legislature
          were to decide that baldness is a disability deserving of certain benefits, then
          the courts might be forced to decide the issue of whether a certain person is bald.
          In everyday life, we are seldom faced with decisions of this kind, and we continue
          to use the concept of baldness without worrying about borderline cases. When someone
          falls into the fuzzy area between bald and hairy, we just say that he is "balding",
          thus avoiding the issue of whether he is now bald.
          <p>
            One reason that so many philosophical debates are seemingly endless and undecidable
            is because they involve a search for a mythical entity, namely, a non-arbitrary
            distinction between concepts which lie upon continua in conceptual space. The logical
            attitude towards such problems is to avoid them if at all possible; but if a decision
            cannot be avoided, then draw an arbitrary line in the gray zone and stick with it.
            Don't be drawn into defending the decision against the charge that it is arbitrary;
            <em>of course</em> it's arbitary, for <em>any</em> such decision will be arbitrary.
            For this reason, it is not a criticism of such decisions to point out their arbitrariness.
            Philosophers, naturally, are uneasy about arbitrariness, but when we are dealing
            with conceptual continua, it is an unavoidable fact of life. Where there is only
            gray, there are no black-and-white distinctions to be made.

              Reader Response:</h3>
            <p>
              Reader Jim Skipper writes:
              <blockquote>
                I have been researching slippery slopes and wonder if you have read Eugene Volokh’s
                paper on the topic. Mr. Volokh demonstrates mechanisms by which slippery slope progressions
                take place in real world situations. While, granted, slippery slope arguments are
                sometimes fallacious, when dealing with people and group behavior, logic and reason
                seldom apply. I point this out because Mr. Volokh’s paper is very impressive and
                he gives a beautiful, real-world example of a slippery slope in action, in which
                someone assures the public that a slippery slope will not happen and then it does:
                <blockquote>
                  [Regarding legislation to outlaw cigarette machines.] "Sandra Starr, vice chairwoman
                  of the Princeton Regional Health Commission&#8230;, said there is no 'slippery slope'
                  toward a total ban on smoking in public places. 'The commission’s overriding concern,'
                  she said, 'is access to the machines by minors.'"&#8213;New York Times, Sept. 5,
                  1993, § 1, at 52.
                  <p>
                  "Last month, the Princeton Regional Health Commission took a bold step to protect
                  its citizens by enacting a ban on smoking in all public places of accommodation,
                  including restaurants and taverns&#8230;. In doing so, Princeton has paved the way
                  for other municipalities to institute similar bans&#8230;."&#8213;The Record (Bergen
                  County), July 12, 2000, at L7</blockquote>
                <p>
                Not only did the PRHC slide down the slippery slope, the Record notes that it will
                pave the way for others to follow the same course, as we have seen throughout the
                United States.</blockquote>
              <p>
                Jim, I agree that Volokh's work is valuable, especially his classification of different
                ways in which slopes can be slippery. You'll notice that I had already included
                a link to his short paper in the Resources listed above, and I've added a link to
                the long version below.
                <p>
                  The fact that I list the causal version of the slippery slope as a fallacy does
                  <em>not</em> mean that every argument with the form of a slippery slope is fallacious;
                  rather, it means that sufficiently many are fallacious to make it worth including
                  as a type of common logical error&#8213;that is, a fallacy.
                  <p>
                    However, I suspect that I'm more skeptical of the slipperiness of slopes than Volokh.
                    While we agree that some slippery slope arguments are <a href="glossary.html#Cogent">
                      cogent</a> and others are fallacious, Volokh seems to think that more are cogent
                    than I do. One reason why I am skeptical has to do with the difficulty of the causal
                    reasoning needed to establish that a slope really is slippery; most slippery slope
                    arguments make little or no attempt to do this hard work. Moreover, it is difficult
                    even in retrospect to tell whether a slippery slope mechanism has actually been
                    at work. This brings me to the example that you cite.
                    <p>
                      In order for the cigarette machine example to show a slippery slope effect, the
                      law banning cigarette machines must have contributed causally to the subsequent
                      ban on smoking in public places. However, from the two newspaper quotes given, all
                      that we know for sure is that the machine ban preceded the smoking ban. To reason
                      that when one event precedes another the former causes the latter is to commit the
                      post hoc fallacy.
                      <p>
                        Volokh is in fact aware of this problem, as he writes:
                        <blockquote>
                          I would have liked to illustrate the discussion with case studies of how the legal
                          system has slipped down various slippery slopes, but unfortunately it’s generally
                          very hard to tell whether legal change A in fact caused legal change B (even if
                          it’s plausible that it did),&#8230;such case studies might therefore have become
                          more controversial than persuasive. (p. 1039, footnote 39)</blockquote>
                        <p>
                          That's another thing that Volokh and I agree on!
