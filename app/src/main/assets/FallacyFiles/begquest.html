    <h3>
      Etymology:</h3>
    <p>
      The phrase "begging the question", or "petitio principii" in Latin, refers to the
      "question" in a formal debate&#8212;that is, the issue being debated. In such a
      debate, one side may ask the other side to concede certain points in order to speed
      up the proceedings. To "beg" the question is to ask that the very point at issue
      be conceded, which is of course illegitimate.
      <p>
        <h3>
          Misrule of Thumb:</h3>
        <p>
          Begging the question is a fallacious form of argument.
          <br />
          Therefore, to beg the question is to argue fallaciously.
          <h3>
            Form:</h3>
          <p>
            Any form of <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a> in which the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
              conclusion</a> occurs as one of the <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a>es,
            or a <a href="glossary.html#ChainOfArguments">chain of arguments</a> in which the
            <a href="glossary.html#FinalConclusion">final conclusion</a> is a premiss of one
            of the earlier arguments in the chain. More generally, an argument begs the question
            when it assumes any controversial point not conceded by the other side.

              Example:</h3>
            <blockquote>
              To cast abortion as a solely private moral question,&#133is to lose touch with common
              sense: How human beings treat one another is practically the definition of a public
              moral matter. Of course, there are many private aspects of human relations, but
              the question whether one human being should be allowed fatally to harm another is
              not one of them. Abortion is an inescapably public matter.</blockquote>

                  Exposition:</h3>
                <p>
                  Unlike most informal fallacies, Begging the Question is a <a href="glossary.html#Validating">
                    validating</a> form of argument. Moreover, if the premisses of an instance of
                  Begging the Question happen to be true, then the argument is <a href="glossary.html#Sound">
                    sound</a>. What is wrong, then, with Begging the Question?
                  <p>
                    First of all, not all circular reasoning is <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>.
                    Suppose, for instance, that we argue that a number of <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">
                      proposition</a>s, <strong>p</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>p</strong><sub>2</sub>,&#133,
                    <strong>p</strong><sub>n</sub> are equivalent by arguing as follows (where "<strong>p</strong>
                    => <strong>q</strong>" means that <strong>p</strong> implies <strong>q</strong>):
                    <p>
                      <strong>p</strong><sub>1</sub> => <strong>p</strong><sub>2</sub> => &#133 => <strong>
                        p</strong><sub>n</sub> => <strong>p</strong><sub>1</sub>
                      <p>
                        Then we have clearly argued in a circle, but this is a standard form of argument
                        in mathematics to show that a set of propositions are all equivalent to each other.
                        So, when is it fallacious to argue in a circle?
                        <p>
                          For an argument to have any epistemological or dialectical force, it must start
                          from premisses already known or believed by its audience, and proceed to a conclusion
                          not known or believed. This, of course, rules out the worst cases of Begging the
                          Question, when the conclusion is the very same proposition as the premiss, since
                          one cannot both believe and not believe the same thing. A viciously circular argument
                          is one with a conclusion based ultimately upon that conclusion itself, and such
                          arguments can never advance our knowledge.

                            <strong>Q&A:</strong>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Q:</strong> In Patrick J. Hurley's <cite>A Concise Introduction to Logic</cite>,
                              (10th ed.) a True/False exercise is posed: "Arguments that commit the fallacy of
                              begging the question are normally valid."
                              <p>
                                Now there certainly are a few things wrong with this question, not the least of
                                which is that Hurley breaks "begging the question" down into three sub-categories,
                                though most sources I've come in contact with cite only "circular reasoning" as
                                the primary example of "begging the question." But he states, "The first, and most
                                common, way of committing this fallacy [of begging the question] is by leaving a
                                possibly false key premise out of the argument while creating the illusion that
                                nothing more is needed to establish the conclusion."
                                <p>
                                  He then gives an example, "Murder is morally wrong. This being the case, it follows
                                  that abortion is morally wrong." Here it seems to me that the example is an invalid
                                  argument. A key premise is missing, and thus the conclusion does not necessarily
                                  follow from the given premise. One might argue that the missing premise is implied,
                                  but if one accepts that then it seems the fallacy isn't an issue so much as the
                                  strength of the implied premise. After all, a valid argument is one in which if
                                  the premises are true, then it is impossible for the conclusion to be false. If
                                  there is only one premise and a second premise linking the first to the conclusion
                                  is missing, then it would be possible to have true premise(s) and a false conclusion,
                                  making the argument invalid. On this basis I answered "False" to the above question.&#8213;John

                                  <p>
                                    <strong>A:</strong> I don't have the tenth edition of Hurley's text; the latest
                                    edition I own is the fifth, from 1994. In that edition, as well as earlier ones
                                    that I also have, he actually defines "begging the question" as a type of <a href="glossary.html#Valid">
                                      valid</a> argument (p. 153). I think that this is a mistake, but it means that
                                    the question you answered "false" would be true by definition. Of course, this raises&#8213;not
                                    "begs"&#8213;the question whether the abortion argument is in fact an example of
                                    begging the question; if it's invalid, then it can't be an instance of begging the
                                    question.
                                    <p>
                                      I think that it's a mistake to define "begging the question" as a type of valid
                                      argument because it's unnecessary, since all circular arguments are valid. As I
                                      mention in the Exposition above, begging the question is a validating form of argument.
                                      This sounds counter-intuitive, especially if you over-estimate the importance of
                                      validity. Validity is a virtue of arguments, but a good argument also needs to be
                                      sound. Moreover, as explained above, even soundness is not enough: a good argument
                                      must actually advance our knowledge or the debate we are in. Begging the question
                                      gets us nowhere, as we just end up going around in circles.
                                      <p>
                                        Why is a circular argument necessarily valid? This surprising fact is a consequence
                                        of the definition of "valid": a valid argument is one in which the truth of the
                                        premisses necessitates the truth of the conclusion. If the conclusion of an argument
                                        is one of its premisses, then clearly the truth of its premisses necessitates the
                                        truth of that conclusion.
                                        <p>
                                          In the fifth edition, Hurley gives the same example and apparently considers "all
                                          abortions are murders" to be a <a href="glossary.html#Suppressed">suppressed</a>
                                          premiss of the argument. So, Hurley takes the complete argument to be:
                                          <blockquote>
                                            Murder is morally wrong.
                                            <br />
                                            All abortions are murders. (Suppressed)
                                            <br />
                                            Therefore, abortion is morally wrong.</blockquote>
                                          <p>
                                            This is certainly a valid argument. Moreover, it doesn't appear to be circular,
                                            since the conclusion is not one of the premisses. Why, then, does it beg the question?
                                            <p>
                                              It begs the question because the word "murder" is not a morally-neutral word, such
                                              as "killing". All murders are killings, but not all killings are murders. A person
                                              who kills someone in self-defense, a soldier who kills in battle, or a policeman
                                              who kills in the line of duty, is not a murderer. So, the first, unsuppressed premiss
                                              is really unnecessary, as the argument is valid without it:
                                              <blockquote>
                                                All abortions are murders.
                                                <br />
                                                Therefore, abortion is morally wrong.</blockquote>
                                              <p>
                                                Or, to spell out what "murder" means:
                                                <blockquote>
                                                  All abortions are wrongful killings.
                                                  <br />
                                                  Therefore, abortion is morally wrong.</blockquote>
                                                <p>
                                                  Which is clearly circular and, therefore, valid. In the original argument, the moral
                                                  wrongness of abortion has been smuggled into the premiss via the morally loaded
                                                  word "murder". This is how real-life questions are often begged, that is, by using
                                                  loaded language to conceal the fact that an argument is circular.

                                                      from its use to refer to the fallacy.

                                                            In your Etymological Fallacy "Exposition" section, you point out that "the meanings
                                                            of words change over time." I state, with zero evidence beyond personal experience,
                                                            that today most people use the phrase "begs the question" to mean "raises the question".
                                                            I have found very few people who were aware of its "Petitio Principii" definition.
                                                            When terms like "Circular Argument" are currently far more clear to the general
                                                            population than "begs the question", why do you suggest that "begs the question"
                                                            should cling to its older definition as opposed to being dropped for its current
                                                            common usage? As I mentioned, I have no hard numerical evidence to back up my claim,
                                                            but I believe the postulate would prove true if studied. I'm sure there would be
                                                            variance between a Harvard Campus study vs. a ghetto study, but I believe the median
                                                            American value would support it.&#8213;Dan Rotelli</blockquote>
                                                          <p>
                                                            I think that you're right about the common use of the phrase "begs the question",
                                                            and the newspaper headlines above are evidence that it usually has the meaning "raises
                                                            the question" among editors and journalists. You also make a good point about the
                                                            alternative name "circular argument", or "circular reasoning", for this fallacy.
                                                            These are far better names than the traditional one, since they give an idea of
                                                            the logical nature of the mistake, as well as being more memorable. "Begging the
                                                            question" has always been a puzzling phrase: Why "beg"? What question? Moreover,
                                                            "begging the question" is a poor translation of the Latin phrase "petitio principii";
                                                            a more accurate translation might be something like "requesting first principles".

                                                              However, these are good arguments for dropping the phrase "begs the question" altogether,
                                                              rather than using it to mean "raises the question". It's still a puzzling phrase
                                                              when used in the common newspaper sense: why "beg" the question? Why should newspaper
                                                              editors use "begs" instead of the available alternatives of "raises", "suggests",
                                                              or "invites" the question? At best, what started out as a misuse of logical jargon
                                                              to impress the reader has turned into an idiom because neither the writer nor reader
                                                              knew what the phrase meant.

                                                                Perhaps saving the logical sense of "begs the question" for common use is a lost
