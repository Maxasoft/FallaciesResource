    How to Read a Poll</h1>
  <img src="http://fallacyfiles.org/DeweyTru.jpg" alt="Dewey Defeats Truman">
  <p>
    Every other year, during election campaigns, the American public is polled, surveyed,
    and canvassed for their opinions, and the news media continuously inform us of the
    results. The media report polls in the same breathless way that race track announcers
    describe horse races: <em>"As they round the corner of the convention, the Republican
      is pulling ahead on the right! Now, they're entering the home stretch and the Democrat
      is pulling up on the left!"</em> Et cetera.
    <p>
      There is little drama in simply waiting until after the election to report the results.
      Instead, reporters use polls to add suspense to their coverage, with a leader and
      an underdog to root for. Moreover, every news outlet is trying to scoop the others
      by being the first to correctly predict the winner. Unfortunately, much of this
      coverage sacrifices accuracy for artificial excitement.
      <p>
        This article explains how a layman can read a news report of a poll without being
        duped by the hype. You don't need to be a statistician to understand enough about
        polls to not be taken in, because the problems are often not with the polls themselves
        but with the way that they're reported.
        <p>
          First, please take the following unscientific poll:

                <a name="Scivself">Scientific Versus Self-Selected</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
              Opinion polls, like other surveys, are a way of inferring the characteristics of
              a large group&#8212called "the population"&#8212from a small sample of it. In order
              for this inference to be <a href="glossary.html#Cogent">cogent</a>, the sample must
              accurately represent the population. Thus, the main error to avoid is an unrepresentative
              sample. For example, the most famous polling fiasco was the <cite>Literary Digest</cite>
              poll in the 1936 presidential election. The magazine surveyed over two million people,
              chosen from the magazine's subscriber list, phone books, and car registrations.
              Even though the sample was enormous, it was unrepresentative of the population of
              voters because not everyone could afford a phone or car during the Depression, and
              those who could tended to vote Republican in greater numbers than those who couldn't.
              As a result of this biased sample, the poll showed Republican Alf Landon beating
              the actual winner, Democrat Franklin Roosevelt.
              <p>
                So, the first question that you should ask of a poll report you read is: "Was the
                sample chosen scientifically?" If the poll is a scientific one, then an effort has
                been made to either choose the sample randomly from the population, or to weight
                it in order to make it representative of the population. Reputable polling organizations
                always use scientific sampling.
                <p>
                  However, many polls are unscientific, such as most online polls you take using a
                  computer, telephone surveys in which you must call a certain number, or mail-in
                  questionaires in magazines or sent to you by charities. Such surveys suffer from
                  the fault that the sample is self-selected, that is, you decide whether you wish
                  to participate. Self-selected samples are not likely to be representative of the
                  population for various reasons:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The readers of a particular magazine or the contributors to a specific charity
                      are likely to differ from the rest of the population in other respects.
                      <li>Those who take the time and trouble to volunteer for a poll are more motivated
                        than the average person, and probably care more about the survey subject.
                        <li>
                    Many such polls allow individuals to vote more than once, thus allowing the results
                    to be skewed by people who stuff the ballot box.</ul>
                  <p>
                    For example, some media outlets sponsor scientific polls but, when the results are
                    reported in their online edition, they are sometimes accompanied by an online poll
                    using a self-selected sample and asking some of the same questions. It is instructive
                    to compare the two, as the results are usually very different.
                    <p>
                      So, self-selected samples are almost inevitably biased and are, at best, a form
                      of entertainment. They cannot be trusted as a source of information about the population
                      as a whole.
                      <hr class="short">
                      <h3>
                        <p>

                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Because polls question only a sample of the population, there is always a chance
                        of sampling error, that is, of drawing a sample that is unrepresentative. For instance,
                        in a political poll, it is possible that a random sample of voters would consist
                        entirely of Democrats, though this is highly unlikely. However, less extreme errors
                        of the same kind are not so unlikely, and this means that every poll has some degree
                        of imprecision or fuzziness. Because the sample may not be precisely representative
                        of the population as a whole, there is some chance that the poll results will be
                        off by a certain amount. Statisticians measure the chance of this kind of error
                        by the "margin of error", or "MoE" for short.
                        <p>
                          The MoE takes the form "&plusmn;N%", where usually N=3 in national polls. This margin
                          determines what is called a "confidence interval": for example, if the percentage
                          of a sample who supports candidate R is 46%, and the MoE is &plusmn;3%, then the
                          confidence interval is 43-49%. In turn, the confidence interval and the MoE are
                          determined by the "level of confidence", which is usually set at 95% in national
                          polls. What this means is that one can have confidence that in 19 out of 20 such
                          samples the percentage of the population who support candidate R will fall within
                          the confidence interval. So, the chance of the poll being off by more than the MoE
                          is only 5%.
                          <p>
                            The MoE is a common source of error in news reports of poll results. Most reputable
                            news sources require their reporters to include the MoE in a report on a poll, at
                            least in a note at the end. However, many reporters ignore the MoE in the body of
                            their articles, perhaps because they don't understand what the number means.
                            <p>
                              Reporters often use polls for "horse race" reporting by comparing the poll numbers
                              of candidates, or to compare current polls to past ones to see if the results are
                              changing. The MoE needs to be factored into such comparisons. For example, suppose
                              that in one poll with a MoE of &plusmn;3%, candidate D polls at 36%, and in a later
                              poll D is at 38%. Many newspapers will report this as a 2% rise in support for D
                              between the two polls, as if 2% of undecided voters or previous supporters of other
                              candidates had decided to vote for D since the previous poll. However, given that
                              the MoE is &plusmn;3%, the result in the first poll could be as high as 39%, and
                              in the second one as low as 35%. In other words, D's support could have dropped
                              by as much as 4%! The poll results are simply not precise enough to say that there
                              is a real increase in D's support, let alone that such an increase is exactly 2%.
                              <p>
                                Also, when comparing two poll numbers, remember that the MoE applies to <em>both</em>
                                numbers. For instance, suppose that in a single poll with a MoE of &plusmn;3%, Candidate
                                D gets 46% and Candidate R only 42%, this will often be reported as a lead for D.
                                However, D's support could be as low as 43% and R's as high as 45%, giving R a 2
                                percentage point lead. So, in order for the absolute difference between two poll
                                numbers to be statistically significant, it must be greater than twice the MoE,
                                which is equal to the confidence interval.

                                  In the previous section, I mentioned the level of confidence&#8212;usually 95%&#8212;used
                                  to determine the MoE and, therefore, the confidence interval. The purpose of a survey
                                  is to measure some characteristic&#8213;such as support for a candidate&#8213;of
                                  a sample in order to be able to infer its level in the whole population. A 95% confidence
                                  level means that in 19 out of 20 samples, the percentage of the sample with the
                                  characteristic should be within the confidence interval of the percentage of the
                                  population with the characteristic.
                                  <p>
                                    95% confidence sounds pretty confident&#8212;and it is!&#8212;however, there are
                                    a lot of polls done these days. In fact, there are many more than 20 national polls
                                    conducted in the U.S. during a presidential election year. This means that even
                                    with a confidence level of 95%, we can expect a few polls to be off by <em>more</em>
                                    than the MoE as a result of sampling error.
                                    <p>
                                      How can we tell when the results of a poll are off by more than the MoE? If a poll
                                      gives very different results from others taken around the same time, or shows a
                                      sudden and large change from previous polls, this suggests that the unusual result
                                      may be due to sampling error. No one can know for sure whether sampling error is
                                      responsible for polls with surprising results, but the fact that 1 in 20 polls can
                                      be expected to be significantly in error should encourage us to regard such poll
                                      results with skepticism. Moreover, it's important to pay attention to all of the
                                      polls taken on a given topic at a particular time, otherwise you'll have no way
                                      of knowing whether a poll you're looking at is giving wildly different results than
                                      comparable polls.

                                          Each of these results is within the MoE so, taken individually, you would have to
                                          conclude that neither candidate is really ahead. However, four of the five polls
                                          show candidate <em>D</em> with a lead, and the other shows a tie; no poll shows
                                          candidate <em>R</em> leading. Of course, it's highly improbable that both candidates
                                          have <em>exactly</em> the same level of support, but if they are within a percentage
                                          point of each another you would expect the polls showing one candidate ahead to
                                          be about evenly divided between the two. Instead, in this example, <em>all</em>
                                          of the polls showing one candidate ahead favor candidate D, which is unlikely unless
                                          D has a real, albeit small, lead.
                                          <p>
                                            Thus, even when individual polls do not show a clear leader, the consensus of all
                                            polls may do so. Unfortunately, news stories on polls usually concentrate on one
                                            poll at the expense of all others. Many polls are sponsored by newspapers or networks,
                                            which get their money's worth by reporting only the results of their own polls,
                                            ignoring those sponsored by their competitors. Therefore, it's up to you to check
                                            to see whether there are other polls on the same topic, and to compare the results
                                            of any comparable polls.

                                              A Checklist of Questions</h3>
                                            <p>
                                              When you are confronted with a new poll, ask the following questions about it:
                                              <ul>
                                                <li>Is the sample scientifically selected or self-selected? If self-selected, the
                                                  poll is only good for entertainment.
                                                  <li>What is the poll's margin of error? Are any comparisons reported&#8213;such as
                                                    changes in popularity, record highs or lows, or comparisons between candidates&#8213;which
                                                    lie within twice the margin of error, that is, the confidence interval? If so, they
                                                    are statistically insignificant.
                                                    <li>Have other polls on this issue been done recently? If so, it is a good idea to
                                                      compare the new poll with these others:
                                                      <ul>
                                                        <li>If the results of the new poll are significantly different from those of most
                                                          other polls&#8213;that is, a difference greater than the confidence interval&#8213;then
                                                          the new poll is probably unreliable.
                                                          <li>
                                                        If the results of the new poll are within the confidence interval from those of
                                                        most other polls, then those results are probably reliable, even if they are not
                                                        statistically significant as individuals.</ul>
                                              </ul>
                                              <p>
                                                If the poll you are confronted with fails at any step of this checklist, or if you
                                                can't find the answer to these questions in the report, then your confidence in
                                                the poll should be much less than 95%.

                                                  than most such polls. If you go back and retake the poll having read the entire
