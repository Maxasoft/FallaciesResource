      Near-perfect correlations exist between the death rate in Hyderabad, India, from
      1911 to 1919, and variations in the membership of the International Association
      of Machinists during the same period. Nobody seriously believes that there is anything
      more than a coincidence in that odd and insignificant fact.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          Charging that welfare causes child poverty, [Gary Bauer] cites a study showing that
          "the highest increases in the rate of child poverty in recent years have occurred
          in those states which pay the highest welfare benefits. The lowest increases&#151or
          actual decreases&#151in child poverty have occurred in states which restrain the
          level of AFDC payments."</blockquote>

            The bigger a child's shoe size, the better the child's handwriting.

            Therefore, having big feet makes it easier to write.

              Exposition:</h3>
            <p>
              Cum Hoc is the fallacy committed when one jumps to a <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
                conclusion</a> about causation based on a correlation between two events, or types
              of event, which occur simultaneously. In order to avoid this fallacy, one needs
              to rule out other possible explanations for the correlation:
              <ul>
                <li>A third event&#151or type of event&#151is the cause of the correlation.
                  <p>
                    For instance, consider the <strong>Counter-Example</strong>: Children's shoe sizes
                    will be positively correlated with many developmental changes, because they are
                    the common effects of growth. As children grow, so do their feet, and their shoe
                    sizes increase, their handwriting improves, and they develop in many other ways.
                    So, growth is the common cause of both increased shoe size and improved handwriting
                    in children.
                    <li>The direction of causation may be the reverse of that in the conclusion.
                      <p>
                        For instance, suppose that statistics show a positive correlation between gun ownership
                        and violent crime, namely, the higher number of guns owned, the higher the rate
                        of violent crime. It would be tempting to jump to the conclusion that gun ownership
                        causes violent crime, but the causal relationship may be the exact reverse. High
                        rates of violent crime may cause fearful citizens to purchase guns for protection.
                        <p>
                          This type of error is what distinguishes <em>cum hoc</em> from its better known
                          sibling <em>post hoc</em>. In a <em>post hoc</em> fallacy, the supposed cause temporally
                          precedes the alleged effect, so there is no possibility that the causal relationship
                          is the reverse.
                          <li>The correlation may simply be coincidence.
                            <p>
                Statistical lore is filled with examples of coincidental correlations, for example

                <blockquote>
                  Bauer uses specious statistical studies to discredit the welfare system. &#133 But
                  this study by two Ohio State University sociologists overlooked the fact that median
                  income declined or was flat in the ten states where welfare costs and child poverty
                  rose, while income rose substantially in nine of the ten states where welfare payments
                  and poverty showed the least increase. The data showed that economic decline caused
                  an increase in both welfare and child poverty.</blockquote>
