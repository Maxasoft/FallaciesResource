    Exposition:</h3>
  <p>
    "Illicit contraposition" is not a scandal from the Reagan administration. Rather,
    "contraposition" refers to the process of switching the subject and predicate <a
      href="glossary.html#Term" title="A word or phrase that can be used to refer to a category, or class, of things.">
      term</a>s of a <a href="glossary.html#CategoricalProp" title="A proposition relating two categories, or classes.">
        categorical proposition</a>, and negating each. For instance, the contraposition
    of "all bats are mammals" is "all non-mammals are non-bats".
    <p>
      Contraposition is a <a href="glossary.html#Validating" title="Of an argument form every instance of which is valid.">
        validating</a> form of <a href="glossary.html#ImmediateInference" title="An argument with exactly one premiss.">
          immediate inference</a> for <a href="glossary.html#Aproposition" title="A proposition of the form: All S are P.">
            A-</a> and <a href="glossary.html#Oproposition" title="A proposition of the form: Some S are not P.">
              O-type categorical proposition</a>s. However, contraposition is a non-validating
      form of inference for <a href="glossary.html#Oproposition" title="A proposition of the form: No S are P.">
        E-</a> or <a href="glossary.html#Iproposition" title="A proposition of the form: Some S are P.">
          I-type proposition</a>s. Hence, contraposing an E- or I-type proposition is
      Illicit Contraposition.
      <h3>
        Exposure:</h3>
      <p>
        The Venn Diagrams above show that the two forms of Illicit Contraposition are not
        validating. The diagram for the E-type proposition shows that no S is P&#8213;which
        is indicated by the blue shading of the overlap of the S and P circles&#8213;but
        it fails to show that there is nothing in the area outside both circles, which is
        the overlap of the non-S and non-P areas. A question mark in an area means that
        it might or might not be empty. Similarly, the diagram for the I-type proposition
        shows that some S is P, but fails to show that there is anything in the area outside
        both circles.
        <p>
          Moreover, the <a href="glossary.html#CounterExample" title="An instance of a form of argument that has true premisses and a false conclusion.">
            Counter-Example</a>s above show that the forms are not validating, since each
          has an instance with a true <a href="glossary.html#Premiss" title="A proposition in an argument presented as evidence for the conclusion.">
            premiss</a> and a false <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion" title="The proposition in an argument for which evidence is provided.">
              conclusion</a>. It's harder to find a Counter-Example to the contraposition
          of I propositions than E ones since, in order for the conclusion of such an I inference
          to be false, the two classes must jointly exhaust the universe but not be mutually
          exclusive. In the Counter-Example, the premiss is true because there are invisible
          physical things, such as atoms; but the conclusion is false because there are no
          visible things that are not physical.
