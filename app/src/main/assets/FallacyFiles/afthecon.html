        Example:</h3>
      <blockquote>
        Never has a book been subjected to such pitiless search for error as the Holy Bible.
        Both reverent and agnostic critics have ploughed and harrowed its passages; but
        through it all God's word has stood supreme&#8230;. This is proof&#8230;that here
        we have a revelation from God; for&#8230;if God reveals himself to man&#8230;, he
        will preserve a record of that revelation in order that men who follow may know
        his way and will.</blockquote>

            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            Affirming the Consequent is a non-<a href="glossary.html#Validating">validating</a>
            form of <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a> in <a href="glossary.html#PropLogic">
              propositional logic</a>; for instance, let "<strong>p</strong>" be false and "<strong>q</strong>"
            be true, then there is no inconsistency in supposing that the first, <a href="glossary.html#ConditionalProp">
              conditional</a> <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a> is true, which makes
            the premisses true and the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">conclusion</a> false.
            <p>
              Together with its similar sibling fallacy, <a href="denyante.html">Denying the Antecedent</a>,
              instances of Affirming the Consequent are most likely to seem <a href="glossary.html#Valid">
                valid</a> when we assume the <a href="glossary.html#Converse">converse</a> of
              the argument's conditional premiss. In the Example, for instance, we may assume:
              <p>
                (<a href="glossary.html#Suppressed">Suppressed</a> Premiss) If the streets are wet
                then it's raining.
                <p>
                  Since wet streets usually dry rapidly, it is a good <a href="glossary.html#Ruleofthumb">
                    rule of thumb</a> that wet streets indicate rain. With this suppressed premiss,
                  the argument in the Example is valid. So, in general, in an instance of the form
                  Affirming the Consequent, if it is reasonable to consider the converse of the conditional
                  premiss to be a suppressed premiss, then the argument is not <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">
                    fallacious</a>, but a valid <a href="glossary.html#Enthymeme">enthymeme</a>.
                  <p>
                    In contrast, it would not be reasonable to consider the <a href="glossary.html#CounterExample">
                      Counter-Example</a> to be an enthymeme, since the converse of its conditional
                    premiss is not plausible, namely:
                    <p>
                      If the streets are covered with snow then it's snowing.
                      <p>
                        Unlike rain, we know, at cold temperatures it takes snow a very long time to evaporate.
                        So that, while snow on the ground is a good sign of past snowing, it's a bad sign
                        of present snowing. Thus, the Counter-Example is a fallacious instance of Affirming
                        the Consequent.

                            <p>
                              The phrase "this is proof that" is an <a href="glossary.html#ArgIndicator">argument
                                indicator</a>, indicating that this passage contains an argument. Specifically,
                              "this is proof that" is a <a href="glossary.html#ConcIndicator">conclusion indicator</a>,
                              which means that the proposition it occurs in is a conclusion: "here [in the Bible]
                              we have a revelation from God". Moreover, the use of the word "proof" also means
                              that the author is claiming that the argument is deductive, that is, that it is
                              the strongest type of reasoning. The word "this" in the conclusion indicator refers
                              back to the preceding proposition, so it is a premiss supporting the conclusion:
                              "Both reverent and agnostic critics have ploughed and harrowed [the Bible's] passages;
                              but through it all God's word has stood supreme." In other words, the author is
                              claiming that the Bible has withstood all criticism. Finally, the word "for" following
                              the conclusion is a <a href="glossary.html#PremIndicator">premiss indicator</a>,
                              meaning that the proposition it occurs in is a further premiss: "if God reveals
                              himself to man, he will preserve a record of that revelation in order that men who
                              follow may know his way and will." Putting these together and simplifying their
                              wording produces the following argument:
                              <iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=thefallacyfil-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=0130258490&fc1=006688&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=006666&bc1=FFFFFF&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr&npa=1"

                                frameborder="0" align="right"></iframe>
                              <blockquote>
                                <strong>Premiss:</strong> If God reveals himself in the Bible, he will preserve
                                a record of that revelation.
                                <br />
                                <strong>Premiss:</strong> God has preserved a record of his revelation.
                                <br />

                              <p>
                                Therefore, the second premiss affirms the consequent of the first premiss, and the
                                conclusion is the antecedent of the first premiss, which means that the argument
                                commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent.
