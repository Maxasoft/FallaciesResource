      Anecdotal Fallacy</h1>

      Thought Experiment:</h3>

    <blockquote>
      Let us suppose that you wish to buy a new car and have decided that on grounds of
      economy and longevity you want to purchase one of those solid, stalwart, middle-class
      Swedish cars&#151either a Volvo or a Saab. As a prudent and sensible buyer, you
      go to <cite>Consumer Reports</cite>, which informs you that the consensus of their
      experts is that the Volvo is mechanically superior, and the consensus of the readership
      is that the Volvo has the better repair record. Armed with this information, you
      decide to go and strike a bargain with the Volvo dealer before the week is out.
      In the interim, however, you go to a cocktail party where you announce this intention
      to an acquaintance. He reacts with disbelief and alarm: "A Volvo! You've got to
      be kidding. My brother-in-law had a Volvo. First, that fancy fuel injection computer
      thing went out. Had to replace it. Then the transmission and the clutch. Finally
      sold it in three years for junk."</blockquote>
    <p>
      Would you still buy the Volvo?

          Example:</h3>
        <blockquote>
          Last year, tens of millions of people bought life insurance for scheduled flights
          of airlines in the United States. Not one of those insured passengers died in a
          crash&#8213;and this was not just a coincidence, at least not to many of the people
          who bought the insurance. No, at some level they believed that their insurance helped
          keep the plane aloft, according to psychologists with new experimental evidence
          of just how weirdly superstitious people can be. &#8230;
          <p>
            Our brains may understand meteorology, but in our guts we still think that not carrying
            an umbrella will make it rain&#8230;. That same magical thinking was evident when&#8230;some
            people [were asked] to imagine buying travel insurance before getting on a plane,
            and others to imagine not buying it because they ran out of time at the airport.
            Sure enough, the ones with insurance figured they were less likely to lose their
            bags, get sick or have an accident.
            <p>
              These results presumably come as no surprise to marketers of travel insurance, which
              is now purchased by half of American leisure travelers&#8213;a fivefold increase
              since 2001, according to the United States Travel Insurance Association. As a purely
              economic investment, some of this insurance can be dubious, particularly the flight
              insurance policies. &#8230;
              <p>
          A magical belief in insurance sounds crazy because at a rational level we realize
          that our decision to forgo an insurance policy is not going to affect pilots or
          mechanics. But&#8230;there’s a logical explanation for this superstition: Because
          calamities are so vivid and easily brought to mind, we tend to overestimate their
          probability when we intuitively judge what will happen if we tempt fate.</blockquote>

            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            People tend to judge the probabilities of types of event by using what is called
            the "availability", or "ease of representation", <a href="glossary.html#Heuristic">
              heuristic</a>.
            <p>
              <strong>The Availability Heuristic:</strong> The easier it is to remember, or to
              imagine, a type of event, the more likely it is that an event of that type will
              occur.
              <p>
                Like all <a href="glossary.html#Ruleofthumb">rules of thumb</a>, the ease of remembering
                or imagining&#151"representing"&#151a type of event is usually good evidence of
                degree of likelihood in ordinary circumstances. Instances of a type of event which
                we frequently experience will be easily remembered, so that that type will be correctly
                judged to be likely by the heuristic. Similarly, if there are many ways that a kind
                of event can come about, then it will be easy to imagine and also likely to happen.
                Moreover, if one has a hard time remembering an event of a given sort, then it is
                probably rare and unlikely. Also, if we cannot even imagine it, then there is probably
                almost no way for it to occur.
                <p>
                  However, as with all rules of thumb, there are circumstances in which the Availability
                  Heuristic leads to false results. Unusual events do happen, and if they happen to
                  us then we tend to overestimate their likeliness when using the Availability Heuristic.
                  You may have had the experience of seeing an accident on the road, then slowing
                  down and driving more carefully afterwards. Of course, it's a good idea to slow
                  down in the immediate vicinity of an accident scene, since there may be wreckage
                  on the road. Also, it's possible that the accident took place where it did because
                  the area is an unusually dangerous one. However, the vivid memory of the accident
                  and your heightened caution may have lasted after you were away from the accident
                  scene. The experience of seeing one makes accidents more available to your memory
                  and imagination, thus making them seem more probable. However, the probability of
                  getting in an accident in one place is not increased by seeing one in another. But
                  when an unusual event is presented vividly to our minds, it becomes more available;
                  and becoming more available, it seems more likely.
                  <p>
                    The Anecdotal Fallacy occurs when a recent memory, an unusual event, or a striking
                    anecdote leads one to overestimate the probability of events of that type occurring&#8213;especially
                    if one has access to better evidence of the frequency of such events. For instance,
                    in the Thought Experiment, if the vividness of your acquaintance's anecdote about
                    his brother-in-law's experience is enough to change your decision to buy the Volvo,
                    you have committed the fallacy.

                        Thanks to Stephen Rowe for a criticism of the auto accident example which led me
