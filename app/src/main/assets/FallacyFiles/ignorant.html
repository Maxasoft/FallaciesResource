    <h3>
      Exposition:</h3>
    <p>
      An appeal to ignorance is an <a href="glossary.html#Argument" title="A unit of reasoning.">
        argument</a> for or against a <a href="glossary.html#Proposition" title="A sentence that is either true or false.">
          proposition</a> on the basis of a lack of evidence against or for it. If there
      is positive evidence for the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion" title="The part of an argument for which evidence is given.">
        conclusion</a>, then of course we have other reasons for accepting it, but a lack
      of evidence by itself is no evidence.
      <h3>
        Exposure:</h3>
      <p>
        There are a few types of reasoning which resemble the fallacy of Appeal to Ignorance,
        and need to be distinguished from it:
        <ol>
          <li>Sometimes it is reasonable to argue from a lack of evidence for a proposition
            to the falsity of that proposition, when there is a presumption that the proposition
            is false. For instance, in American criminal law there is a presumption of innocence,
            which means that the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and if the prosecution
            fails to provide evidence of guilt then the jury must conclude that the defendant
            is not guilty.
            <p>
              Similarly, the burden of proof is usually on a person making a new or improbable
              claim, and the presumption may be that such a claim is false. For instance, suppose
              that someone claims that the president was taken by flying saucer to another planet,
              but when challenged can supply no evidence of this unusual trip. It would not be
              an Appeal to Ignorance for you to reason that, since there is no evidence that the
              president visited another planet, therefore he probably didn't do so.
              <li>We sometimes have meta-knowledge&#151that is, knowledge about knowledge&#151which
                can justify inferring a conclusion based upon a lack of evidence. For instance,
                schedules&#151such as those for buses, trains, and airplanes&#151list times and
                locations of arrivals and departures. Such schedules usually do <em>not</em> attempt
                to list the times and locations when vehicles do <em>not</em> arrive or depart,
                since this would be highly inefficient. Instead, there is an implicit, understood
                assumption that such a schedule is complete, that all available vehicle departures
                and arrivals have been listed. Thus, we can reason using the following sort of <a
                  href="glossary.html#Enthymeme" title="An incomplete argument.">enthymeme</a>:
                <p>
                  There is no departure/arrival listed in the schedule for location <strong>L</strong>
                  at time <strong>T</strong>.
                  <br />
                  <strong><a href="glossary.html#Suppressed" title="Unstated.">Suppressed</a> <a href="glossary.html#Premiss"
                    title="The part of an argument that gives evidence.">Premiss</a>:</strong> All
                  departures and arrivals are listed in the schedule.
                  <br />
                  Therefore, there is no departure/arrival for location <strong>L</strong> at time
                  <strong>T</strong>.
                  <p>
                    This kind of completeness of information assumption is often called the "closed
                    world assumption". When it is reasonable to accept this assumption&#151as with plane
                    or bus schedules&#151it is not a fallacy of appeal to ignorance to reason this way.
                    <li>Another type of reasoning is called "auto-epistemic" ("self-knowing") because
                      it involves reasoning from premisses about what one actually knows and what one
                      <em>would</em> know if something were true. The form of such reasoning is:
                      <p>
                        If <strong>p</strong> were true, then I would know that <strong>p</strong>.
                        <br />
                        I don't know that <strong>p</strong>.
                        <br />
                        Therefore, <strong>p</strong> is false.
                        <p>
                          For instance, one might reason:
                          <p>
                            If I were adopted, then I would know about it by now.
                            <br />
                            I don't know that I'm adopted.
                            <br />
                            Therefore, I wasn't adopted.
                            <p>
                              Similarly, when extensive investigation has been undertaken, it is often reasonable
                              to infer that something is false based upon a lack of positive evidence for it.
                              For instance, if a drug has been subjected to lengthy testing for harmful effects
                              and none has been discovered, it is then reasonable to conclude that it is safe.
                              Another example is:
                              <p>
                                If there really were a large and unusual type of animal in Loch Ness, then we would
                                have undeniable evidence of it by now.
                                <br />
                                We don't have undeniable evidence of a large, unfamiliar animal in Loch Ness.
                                <br />
                                Therefore, there is no such animal.
                                <p>
          As with reasoning using the closed world assumption, auto-epistemic reasoning does
          not commit the fallacy of Argument from Ignorance.</ol>

          Reader Response:</h3>
        <blockquote>
          When reading up on Appeal to Ignorance I found I don't agree with your remarks around
          auto-epistemic reasoning. I hope you can clear this up.
          <p>
            What I don't get is how auto-epistemic reasoning is not a case of Appeal to Ignorance.
            In the examples, it looks like the circumstances are such that the reader should
            somehow feel that it's okay to break the rule. It seems to me that the rules of
            logic don't change if something is particularly unlikely or insane.
            <p>
              The reasoning in the example is inconclusive: even though reasonable people should
              assume there is no Loch Ness monster for lack of evidence, this lack of evidence
              is not conclusive proof of the monster's nonexistence.
              <p>
          The premise that all large and unusual types of animal result in undeniable evidence
          of their existence is false. For example, the existence of large deep-sea squids
          has long been denied for lack of undeniable evidence. Loch Ness is much smaller
          than the world's oceans and it has been researched far more than reasonable, but
          still finding evidence of a monster is a matter of chance. I'm convinced that the
          chances that Nessie is still eluding us are so small that it would be insane to
          operate under the assumption that she might be real, but that doesn't prove anything
          absolutely.&#8213;Iwein Fuld</blockquote>
        <p>
          You've argued yourself right up to the solution to this quandary, and there's only
          one further step to take. You say that reasonable people should reject the existence
          of a monster in Loch Ness based on a lack of evidence, but that this lack is not
          proof of its non-existence.
          <p>
            The step you need to take here is to realize that auto-epistemic reasoning is a
            type of <a href="glossary.html#Inductive">inductive</a> reasoning, rather than <a
              href="glossary.html#Deductive">deductive</a>. That is, auto-epistemic reasoning
            is not conclusive, and does not prove anything; at best, it gives a probability
            that its conclusion is true. However, as in the case of Nessie, sometimes the reasoning
            makes the conclusion so overwhelmingly probable that only "insane" or unreasonable
            people would refuse to accept it. So, while everything you say about Loch Ness and
            deep-sea squids is correct, all that it shows is that the there is still a bare
            possibility that a large, unknown animal lives in the Loch. Granted, but it's extremely
            improbable.
            <p>
              A further, important point concerns your remark that auto-epistemic reasoning "breaks
              the rule" against appealing to ignorance. A general fact about logical fallacies
              is that there are always exceptions to the rule, and this is especially true for
              informal fallacies, such as appeal to ignorance. That a logical fallacy is informal
              means that one cannot tell simply from the form of an argument that the fallacy
              has been committed; instead, one has to pay attention to the argument's content.
              In other words, there are non-<a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>
              arguments which have the same form as the fallacy.
              <p>
                I included the discussions of presumptions, the closed-world assumption, and auto-epistemic
                reasoning because these are all exceptions to the rule against appealing to ignorance.
                They are all types of argument that have the form of an appeal to ignorance, but
                do not commit the fallacy because of their content.
                <p>
  I hope that clears it up!
