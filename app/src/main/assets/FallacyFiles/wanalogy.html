      <p>
        Efforts to ban chlordane assailed
        <p>
          WASHINGTON (AP)--The only exterminator in Congress told his colleagues Wednesday
          that it would be a short-sighted move to ban use of chlordane and related termiticides
          that cause cancer in laboratory animals.
          <p>
            Supporters of the bill, however, claimed that the Environmental Protection Agency
            was "dragging its feet" on a chemical that could cause 300,000 cancers in the American
            population in 70 years.
            <p>
              "This bill reminds me of legislation that ought to be introduced to outlaw automobiles"
              on the grounds that cars kill people, said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who owns an
              exterminating business.
              <p>
                EPA banned use of the chemicals on crops in 1974, but permitted use against termites
                because the agency did not believe humans were exposed. Chlordane does not kill
                termites but rather drives them away.

        Exposition:</h3>
      <p>
        This is a very common fallacy, but "False Analogy", its common name, is very misleading.
        Analogies are neither true nor false, instead they come in degrees from near identity
        to extreme dissimilarity. Here are two important points about analogy:
        <ol>
          <li>No analogy is perfect, that is, there is always some difference between analogs.
            Otherwise, they would not be two analogous objects, but only one, and the relation
            would be one of identity, not analogy.
            <li>There is always <em>some</em> similarity between any two objects, no matter how
              different. For example, Lewis Carroll once posed the following nonsense riddle:
              <p>
                How is a raven like a writing desk?
                <p>
                  The point of the riddle was that they're <em>not</em>; alike, that is. However,
                  to Carroll's surprise, some of his readers came up with clever solutions to the
                  supposedly unsolvable riddle, for instance:
                  <p>
          Because Poe wrote on both.</ol>
        <p>
          Some <a href="glossary.html#ArgumentByAnalogy">arguments from analogy</a> are based
          on analogies that are so weak that the <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>
          is too weak for the purpose to which it is put. How strong an argument needs to
          be depends upon the context in which it occurs, and the use that it is intended
          to serve. Thus, in the absence of other evidence, and as a guide to further research,
          even a very weak analogical argument may be strong enough. Therefore, while the
          strength of an argument from analogy depends upon the strength of the analogy in
          its <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a>es, it is not solely determined by
          that strength.

          <p>
            Representative DeLay attempts to argue against a bill banning chlordane by comparing
            it to a bill banning automobiles, but this analogy is very weak. Here are some of
            the relevant differences:
            <ul>
              <li>Banning automobiles would be economically and socially disruptive in a way that
                banning a single pesticide would not.
                <li>There are many alternative pesticides available to replace a banned one, but there
                  are few modes of transportation available which could replace cars.
                  <li>
              Automobiles play a significant role in our society, whereas chlordane was used only
              to prevent termite damage to houses, which is of comparatively minor importance.</ul>
