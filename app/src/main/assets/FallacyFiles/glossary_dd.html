    entries in <a href="ffweblog.html">the weblog</a>. The first occurrence of a defined
    term in a file or weblog entry is linked directly to its definition below. Since
    most of the terms are linked from multiple files, you will need to use the "Back"

    <dt><a name="AdHocHyp"><em>Ad hoc</em> hypothesis</a></dt>
    <dd>
      An auxilliary hypothesis that lacks independent support which is adopted to save
      a theory from refutation. Such hypotheses are bad because any theory can be rescued
      from refutation in this way. Auxilliary hypotheses should be justified by independent
      evidence.
      <p>
        <strong>Translation:</strong> "<em>Ad hoc</em>" means "to this", indicating that
        something is for a specific, limited purpose. For instance, an <em>ad hoc</em> committee
        is a temporary one set up to deal with a specific problem.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Before Kepler, astronomers believed that planets moved
        in circular orbits. However, observations of planetary positions did not fit with
        this theory. The theory was saved from refutation by adopting the <em>ad hoc</em>
        hypothesis of epicycles. Of course, the theory should have been rejected because
        planets do not move in circular orbits.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Afortiori"><em>A fortiori</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      <strong>Translation:</strong> "Even more so; by a stronger reason" (<em>Latin</em>).
      <p>
        This phrase is used when arguing that what is true of a given case because it possesses
        a certain attribute will certainly be true of another case which has more of the
        relevant attribute.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Suppose that Tommy is Timmy's older brother. We can argue
        that if Tommy is too young to see a certain movie, then <em>a fortiori</em> Timmy
        is too young, as well, since he is younger than Tommy.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="AffirmCatProp"><em>Affirmative categorical proposition</em></a></dt>

    <dt><a name="Antecedent"><em>Antecedent</em></a></dt>
    <dd>

    <dt><a name="Aproposition"><em>A-type proposition</em></a>
      <img src="http://fallacyfiles.org/VennDiagramA.gif" alt="All S are P." />
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A proposition of the form: All <strong>S</strong> are <strong>P</strong>. The subject
      term, <strong>S</strong>, is distributed.
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> All monkeys are primates.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Argument"><em>Argument</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A unit of reasoning composed of propositions.</dd>
    <dt><a name="ArgumentByAnalogy"><em>Argument by analogy</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      An argument of the form:
      <p>
        <strong>s</strong> and <strong>t</strong> share the properties <strong>P<sub>1</sub></strong>,&#133,
        <strong>P<sub>m</sub></strong>.
        <br />
        <strong>s</strong> has the property <strong>P<sub>n</sub></strong>.
        <br />

    </dd>
    <dt><a name="ArgIndicator"><em>Argument Indicator</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A word or phrase that indicates the occurrence of an argument. There are two types
      of argument indicator: premiss indicators and conclusion indicators.
      <p>
        <strong>Examples:</strong> "Therefore" and "inasmuch as".</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Barbara"><em>Barbara</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      Not Streisand, but the most famous form of categorical syllogism:
      <p>
        All <strong>M</strong> are <strong>P</strong>.
        <br />
        All <strong>S</strong> are <strong>M</strong>.
        <br />
        Therefore, all <strong>S</strong> are <strong>P</strong>.</p>
      <p>
        The name "Barbara" came from a Medieval mnemonic poem for remembering validating
        forms of categorical syllogism, and the vowels indicate that the three propositions
        in this form are all A-type.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="BiconditionalProp"><em>Biconditional Proposition</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A proposition of the form: <strong>p</strong> if and only if <strong>q</strong>.
      A bi-("two")conditional proposition is equivalent to the conjunction of two conditional
      propositions: if <strong>p</strong> then <strong>q</strong> and if <strong>q</strong>
      then <strong>p</strong>.</dd>
    <dt><a name="Boobytrap"><em>Boobytrap</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A linguistic snare which is not itself fallacious, but may cause someone to inadvertently
      commit a fallacy. For instance, an ambiguous or vague sentence is not in and of
      itself fallacious, since it is not an argument, but it may cause somebody to infer
      a false conclusion.</dd>
    <dt><a name="BorderlineCase"><em>Borderline case</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A case in which it is unclear whether a vague terms applies or not.
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> A balding man is a borderline case of baldness, because
        it is not clear whether the vague term "bald" applies to him or not.

    <dt><a name="ContingentProp"><em>Contingent Proposition</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A proposition which is neither logically true nor logically false, that is, its
      truth-value depends upon facts about the world.
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Contradictory"><em>Contradictory Propositions</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      Two propositions are contradictories when they must have opposite truth-values,
      that is, one must be true and the other false.
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
      "Napoleon was short" and "Napoleon was not short" are contradictories.
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="ContraryProps"><em>Contrary Propositions</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      Propositions are contraries when they cannot all be true.
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
      "Napoleon was short" and "Napoleon was tall" are contraries.
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Converse"><em>Converse of a conditional</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A conditional proposition with the antecedent and consequent of another conditional
      proposition switched.

    <dt><a name="CounterExample"><em>Counter-example</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      There are two types of counter-example:
      <ol>
        <li>A counter-example to a proposition: This is a true proposition which shows that
          a contrary proposition is false.
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> "John is an honest lawyer" is a counter-example to "all
            lawyers are dishonest".
            <li>
        A counter-example to an argument form: This is an instance of that form which has
        true premisses and a false conclusion, showing that the form is non-validating.</ol>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="DangComp"><em>Dangling Comparative</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A comparative is a phrase comparing two or more things.
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> "Jimmy is taller than Timmy."
        <p>
          A <em>dangling</em> comparative is one in which one of the things being compared
          is missing.
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> "Jimmy is taller."
            <p>
      Though context often makes it clear what things are being compared, a dangling comparative
      can be ambiguous and, thus, a logical boobytrap.
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Deductive"><em>Deductive</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      Of an argument in which the logical connection between premisses and conclusion
      is claimed to be one of necessity.

    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Definiens"><em>Definiens</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      The word or phrase in a definition that does the defining.

            not rainy and it's not snowy".
            <p>
              And:</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>&#126;(p & q)</strong> is equivalent to <strong>(&#126;p v &#126;q)</strong>

            it's not rainy or it's not snowy".</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Etymology:</strong> These laws are named for the logician Augustus De Morgan.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Disjoint"><em>Disjoint</em></a></dt>
    <dd>

        or it's snowing."</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Disjunction"><em>Disjunction</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A proposition of the "either&#133or" form. A disjunction is true if one or both
      of its disjuncts is true; otherwise, it is false.
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> "Either it's raining or it's snowing."</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Disjunctive"><em>Disjunctive</em></a></dt>

    <dt><a name="Distributed"><em>Distributed</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A term in a categorical proposition is distributed if and only if the proposition
      implies every proposition that results from replacing the term with a more specific
      term.
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> The subject term "mammals" in "all mammals are animals"
        is distributed because the proposition implies "all cats are animals", "all dogs
        are animals", "all humans are animals", etc. In contrast, the predicate term "animals"
        is not distributed because the proposition doesn't imply that all mammals are cats.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Distribution"><em>Distribution</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A characteristic of terms in categorical propositions which are either distributed

    </dd>
    <dt><a name="ExistentialQuant"><em>Existential quantifier</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      A quantifer which indicates that some member of a class has a property.

      The conclusion of the last argument in a chain of arguments, which is not a premiss
      in any argument of the chain.
    </dd>
    <dt><a name="Generalization"><em>Generalization</em></a></dt>

    <dt><a name="InverseOfRelation"><em>Inverse of a relation</em></a></dt>
    <dd>
      The inverse of a relation between two things is simply the same relationship in
      the opposite direction. For instance, the relation of being shorter than is the
      inverse of the relation of being taller than; if Jack is taller than Jill, then
      Jill is shorter than Jack. In other words, the relationship of height between Jack
      and Jill is the same, but in the first case Jack bears the relation to Jill, whereas
      in the second Jill bears it to Jack.

      In an argument, a proposition presented as evidence for the conclusion. "Premiss"
      is a technical term in logic, which is frequently spelled "premise". Both are correct
      spellings, but I choose to follow the logician Charles Sanders Peirce in using the
      double-<em>s</em> spelling throughout the <em>Fallacy Files</em>. The reason for
      this is to avoid any <a href="#Ambiguity">ambiguity</a> created by other uses of
      the word "premise".</dd>

      often ambiguous.

      "Valid" is an ambiguous adjective which is used in two related senses:

        <li>Of argument <em>forms</em> every instance of which are "valid" in sense 1. See
          "validating".</li></ol>
      <p>
        Usually context, namely, whether the subject is an argument or argument form, makes
        it clear which of these meanings is intended. However, sometimes this ambiguity
        is a <em>boobytrap</em> which leads to confusion. For this reason, in the Fallacy
        Files, I use "valid" only in sense 1, and "validating" for sense 2.
