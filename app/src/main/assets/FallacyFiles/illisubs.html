      Exposition:</h3>
    <p>
      Substitution of Identicals, also known as "<a href="glossary.html#LeibnizLaw">Leibniz'
        Law</a>", is a <a href="glossary.html#Validating">validating</a> form of <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
          argument</a> so long as the context in which it occurs is what is called "extensional",
      or "referentially transparent". What is an "intensional" or "referentially opaque"
      context? Basically, it's one in which Leibniz' Law does not hold! This is not very
      helpful, but the distinction can be drawn by examples:
      <p>
        Given that Mark Twain wrote <cite>Huck Finn</cite> and that Sam Clemens was the
        same person as Mark Twain, then Sam Clemens wrote <cite>Huck Finn</cite>. The context
        "<strong>x</strong> wrote <cite>Huck Finn</cite>" is extensional, which means that
        we can validly substitute identicals within it. In contrast, if Joe said "Mark Twain
        wrote <cite>Huck Finn</cite>", it does not follow that he said "Sam Clemens wrote
        <cite>Huck Finn</cite>", for he may have said no such thing. A quoted context is
        an intensional&#8213;or, referentially opaque&#8213;context, as are such other contexts
        as:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Propositional attitudes</strong>: belief, desire, fear, etc. A "propositional
            attitude" is a context that expresses the "attitude" of a person towards a <a href="glossary.html#Proposition"
              title="A sentence with a truth-value.">proposition</a>. For instance, consider
            the proposition "Satan exists". "Larry believes that Satan exists", "Curly desires
            that Satan exists", and "Moe fears that Satan exists", report propositional attitudes,
            specifically, the attitudes of Larry, Curly, and Moe towards the proposition that
            Satan exists.
            <li><strong>Modal contexts</strong>: necessity, possibility, etc. Propositions
          involving modalities, such as necessity and related notions, are intensional. For
          example, it's true that Sam Clemens was necessarily identical to Sam Clemens. However,
          it is false that Sam Clemens was necessarily identical to Mark Twain, even though
          Sam Clemens was, in fact, identical to Mark Twain. Clemens could have chosen a different
          pen name, or died young, or decided not to be a writer, etc. It's the context of
          necessity here which makes the proposition intensional.</ul>

        <p>
          The Fallacy of Illicit Substitution of Identicals&#151or, more colorfully, "The
          Masked Man Fallacy"&#151is an application of Leibniz' Law within an intensional
          context. The most familiar uses of Substitution of Identicals are mathematical,
          where the contexts are always extensional. This may mislead one into thinking that
          substitution is valid in all contexts, but we have seen that this is not the case.
