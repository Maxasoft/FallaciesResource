  <h3>
    Example:</h3>
  <blockquote>
    If you know something then you cannot be mistaken. But if you cannot be mistaken,
    then you are certain. Thus, certainty is a necessary condition of knowledge. If
    you're uncertain, then you don't really know, but the only things that you can be
    truly certain of are logic and mathematics. Therefore, there is no knowledge of
    anything outside of logic and math.</blockquote>

      Counter-Example:</h3>
    <blockquote>
      If a man is a bachelor then he cannot be married, but if he cannot be married then
      he must be a priest. Therefore, all bachelors are priests.</blockquote>
    <h3>
      Exposition:</h3>
    <p>
      Modalities, like other logical concepts such as <a href="glossary.html#Negation">negation</a>,
      have scope, that is, they logically influence a part of any sentence in which they
      occur. Moreover, in English grammar the scope of modalities is often <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguous">
        ambiguous</a>. Compare the following sentences with their modal terms highlighted:
      <ul>
        <li>"If George is President, then he <em>must</em> be older than 35."
          <li>"If God exists, then he <em>necessarily</em>
        exists."</ul>
      <p>
        Though these two propositions have different subject matter, they seem to have the
        same form: both appear to be <a href="glossary.html#ConditionalProp">conditional proposition</a>s,
        and the modal words&#8213;"must" and "necessarily"&#8213;in them are embedded in
        their <a href="glossary.html#Consequent">consequent</a>s. However, on the most plausible
        interpretations, the modalities differ in scope. Here are the most plausible readings
        of the examples:
        <ul>
          <li>"It must be the case that if George is President then he is older than 35."
            <p>
              In this example, "must" has broad scope over the whole conditional proposition.
              That is, the proposition says that it is a necessary truth that if George is President
              then, based upon a constitutional rule, he is older than 35. If the "must" had narrow
              scope, then it would say that if George is president then he is necessarily older
              than 35. But this is false, since no one is necessarily older than 35; that one
              is a certain age is a contingent fact, not a necessary one.
              <li>"If God exists, then it is necessary that he exists."
                <p>
                  In this example, "necessary" has narrow scope, that is, its scope is restricted
                  to the proposition's consequent, rather than the whole proposition. The proposition
                  claims that <em>if</em>
          God does in fact exist, then His existence is a necessary one. This is a special
          claim about God which is not true of other things; for instance, it is thankfully
          not the case that if Osama bin Laden exists then he necessarily exists. If the scope
          of the modality were broad, then the proposition would say that it is necessarily
          the case that if God exists then He exists. While this is true, it is true of everything
          including Osama bin Laden.</ul>
        <p>
          In these two examples it is clear what the scope of the modality is, but in other
          sentences it is not clear whether the modality has a broad or narrow scope. The
          modal scope fallacy occurs when this amphiboly is exploited.
          <h3>
            <a name="Analysis">Analysis of the Example:</a></h3>
          <p>
            Simplified a little, the example <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a> is
            the following:
            <ol>
              <li>If you know something, then you cannot be mistaken about it.
                <li>If you cannot be mistaken, then you are certain.
                  <li>
              Therefore, if you know something, then you are certain about it.</ol>
            <p>
              The scope ambiguity is found in the first <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a>,
              where the alethic modality "cannot" may have two scopes:
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Narrow Scope:</strong> If you know something, then it is impossible for
                  you to be mistaken about it.
                  <li><strong>Wide Scope:</strong>
                It is impossible to both know something and be mistaken about it.</ol>
              <p>
                The modality in the first premiss must have narrow scope in order for the argument
                to be <a href="glossary.html#Valid">valid</a>, but the modality must have wide scope
                in order for the premiss to be obviously true. The wide scope reading is uncontroversially
                true: it is impossible to know a falsehood. However, the narrow scope reading is
                at least controversial, and probably false: knowledge does not require the impossibility
                of error, merely its lack.

                    "'The' Modal Fallacy"</a>. "<em>The</em> modal fallacy", as Swartz refers to it,
                  is the modal scope fallacy. There are other fallacies involving modalities, but
                  this is probably the most common one. Swartz provides many examples of the fallacy
                  using different types of modalities. The article is moderately technical, and uses
                  some logical symbolism without explanation.

                    Franz&eacute;n complains about fallacy lists and the fact that the modal scope fallacy
                    is usually missing from such lists, and gives an example of the fallacy encountered
                    in debates on the web. Franz&eacute;n goes on to complain about what I call "fallacy
                    abuse"&#8213;for instance, the tendencies to think that every bad argument is an
                    instance of some named fallacy, or to hastily denounce debate opponents' arguments
                    as fallacious before understanding them. Some of these errors are the result of
                    what Pope denounced as "a little learning", which can only be remedied by more learning,
                    a lack that this entry may help to fill.</ul>
