  <h3>
    Etymology:</h3>
  <p>
    "Straw man" is one of the best-named fallacies, because it is memorable and vividly
    illustrates the nature of the fallacy. Imagine a fight in which one of the combatants
    sets up a man of straw, attacks it, then proclaims victory. All the while, the real
    opponent stands by untouched.

    <blockquote>
      When your opponent sets up a straw man, set it on fire and kick the cinders around
      the stage. Don't worry about losing the Strawperson-American community vote.</blockquote>

            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            Judging from my experience, Straw Man is one of the commonest of fallacies. It is
            endemic in public debates on politics, ethics, and religion. A straw man <a href="glossary.html#Argument"
              title="A unit of reasoning.">argument</a> occurs in the context of a debate&#8213;formal
            or informal&#8213;when one side attacks a position&#8213;the "straw man"&#8213;not
            held by the other side, then acts as though the other side's position has been refuted.
            <p>
              This fallacy is a type of Red Herring because the arguer is attempting to refute
              the other side's position, and in the context is required to do so, but instead
              attacks a position not held by the other side. The arguer argues to a <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion"
                title="The part of an argument for which evidence is given.">conclusion</a> that
              denies the "straw man", but misses the target. There may be nothing wrong with the
              argument presented by the arguer when it is taken out of context, that is, it may
              be a perfectly good argument against the straw man. It is only because the burden
              of proof is on the arguer to argue against the opponent's position that a Straw
              Man fallacy is committed. So, the fallacy is not simply the argument, but the entire
              situation of the argument occurring in such a context.
              <h3>
                <a href="glossary.html#Subfallacy" title="A fallacy that is a specific type of a more general one.">
                  Subfallacy</a>:</h3>
              <p>
                As the "straw man" metaphor suggests, the counterfeit position attacked in a Straw
                Man argument is typically weaker than the opponent's actual position, just as a
                straw man is easier to defeat than a flesh-and-blood one. Of course, this is no
                accident, but is part of what makes the fallacy tempting to commit, especially to
                a desperate debater who is losing an argument. Thus, it is no surprise that arguers
                seldom misstate their opponent's position so as to make it <em>stronger</em>. Of
                course, if there is an obvious way to make a debating opponent's position stronger,
                then one is up against an incompetent debater. Debaters usually try to take the
                strongest position they can, so that <em>any</em> change is likely to be for the
                worse. However, attacking a logically stronger position than that taken by the opponent
                is a sign of strength, whereas attacking a straw man is a sign of weakness.
                <p>
                  A common straw man is an extreme man. Extreme positions are more difficult to defend
                  because they make fewer allowances for exceptions, or counter-examples. Consider
                  the statement forms:
                  <ul>
                    <li>All <strong>P</strong> are <strong>Q</strong>.
                      <li>Most <strong>P</strong> are <strong>Q</strong>.
                        <li>Many <strong>P</strong> are <strong>Q</strong>.
                          <li>Some <strong>P</strong> are <strong>Q</strong>.
                            <li>Some <strong>P</strong> are not <strong>Q</strong>.
                              <li>Many <strong>P</strong> are not <strong>Q</strong>.
                                <li>Most <b>P</b> are not <b>Q</b>.
                                  <li>No <b>P</b> are <b>Q</b>.</ul>
                  <p>
                    The extremes are "All <strong>P</strong> are <strong>Q</strong>" and "No <strong>P</strong>
                    are <strong>Q</strong>". These are easiest to refute, since all it takes is a single
                    <a href="glossary.html#CounterExample">counter-example</a> to refute a <a href="glossary.html#UniversalGen">
                      universal proposition</a>. Moreover, the world being such as it is, unless <strong>
                        P</strong> and <strong>Q</strong> are connected definitionally, such propositions
                    are usually false. The other propositions are progressively harder to refute until
                    you get to the middle two: "Some <strong>P</strong> are <strong>Q</strong>" and
                    "Some <strong>P</strong> are not <strong>Q</strong>". To refute these requires one
                    to prove the extremes: "No <strong>P</strong> are <strong>Q</strong>" or "All <strong>
                      P</strong> are <strong>Q</strong>", respectively. So, extremists are those who
                    take positions starting with "all" or "no". For instance, the extremists in the
                    abortion debate are those who argue that <em>no</em> abortions are permissible,
                    or that <em>all</em> abortions are.
                    <p>
                      Therefore, Straw Man arguments often attack a political party or movement at its
                      extremes, where it is weakest. For example, it is a straw man to portray the anti-abortion
                      position as the claim that all abortions, with no exceptions, are wrong. It is also
                      a straw man to attack abortion rights as the position that no abortions should ever
                      be restricted, bar none. Such straw men are often part of the process of "demonization",
                      and we might well call the subfallacy of the straw man which attacks an extreme
                      position instead of the more moderate position held by the opponent, the "Straw
                      Demon".

                            Dobson is arguing against the "safe sex" idea of promoting condom usage as a way
                            to limit the spread of HIV. In order to more easily knock down his target, Dobson
                            portrays the sexologists he's criticizing as telling kids "that they can sleep around
                            with impunity". The most prominent proponent of condom usage was Surgeon General
                            C. Everett Koop, who testified before Congress to the following:
                            <blockquote>
                              Scientific evidence indicates that abstinence is the only completely safe way to
                              avoid acquiring AIDS sexually. Except for mutually faithful monogamous relationships
                              with uninfected partners, the use of a condom is the best method of reducing or
                              preventing HIV infection known at this time for those who for one reason or another
                              will not practice abstinence or monogamy.</blockquote>
                            <p>
                              Dobson chose to attack a straw man rather than the Surgeon General.

                                    Dobson was not saying that the Surgeon General was mistaken but rather certain sexologists.
                                    Dobson portrays the sexologists he's criticizing as telling kids "that they can
                                    sleep around with impunity." This was indeed a straw man if they didn't believe
                                    this, but if they did believe this, Dobson's objection is not as much of a straw
                                    man. Ordinarily, something is a straw man if the opponent's position has been distorted,
                                    not that a different opponent presents a different position.
                                    <p>
                                    If the Surgeon General was at the conference, then indeed it was a straw man, but
                                    then that fact should be mentioned. Or if your objection was that the sexologists
                                    Dobson criticizes hold an extreme position, and that most people who promote condom
                                    use don't hold such a position&#8213;whereas Dobson argues otherwise in his fundraising
                                    letter (I don't know if he in fact did or not)&#8213;then this too would be a straw
                                    man, but such pertinent facts would need to be mentioned.&#8213;Wade A. Tisthammer</blockquote>
                                  <p>
                                    Dobson wasn't simply arguing against the 800 sexologists at the conference, but
                                    against the "safe sex" message and in favor of abstinence. I don't know whether
                                    Koop attended the conference, but I doubt it; I have no idea who was there. As you
                                    say, either Dobson misrepresented the views of the sexologists or he didn't. If
                                    he did, then he was clearly committing a straw man fallacy, as you concede.
                                    <p>
                                      One reason that I quoted Koop's statement was that he was probably the most prominent
                                      proponent of condom usage, at least at that time. Of course, statements from those
                                      who attended the conference would be better evidence of what they believed, but
                                      in lieu of that I offer Koop's statement as evidence of what the "safe sex" message
                                      really was. An important thing shown by Koop's statement is that "safe sex" and
                                      abstinence were not necessarily contradictory messages, as Dobson implies. Koop
                                      first points out that abstinence is the only 100% effective method of preventing
                                      diseases from being sexually transmitted, and condom usage is less effective. Of
                                      course, Koop never claimed that teenagers could "sleep around with impunity".
                                      <p>
                                        But, even if Dobson was not misrepresenting the sexologists' views, he still attacked
                                        a straw man. Choosing the most extreme representatives of a view to criticize, and
                                        then treating such criticism as a refutation of that view is itself a form of straw
                                        man fallacy, as discussed in the Subfallacy section above. Dobson chose to attack
                                        the sexologists rather than Koop because they would be easier to knock down: that's
                                        a straw man.

                                            I don't think the safe sex quote is a good example of a straw man argument&#8213;or
                                            perhaps it needs more clarification. You pointed out that the straw man aspect to
                                            the argument was that Dobson painted the safe sex movement as telling kids they
                                            can sleep around with impunity. I don't think that's a straw man, primarily because
                                            he uses the word "can" and adds "with impunity". If Dobson said "telling kids they
                                            should sleep around" you'd be correct&#8213;that's a mischaracterization of safe
                                            sex. But the idea of "safe sex" is exactly that "you can sleep around with impunity".
                                            That's the definition of safe sex. It adds impunity to sex "for those who for one
                                            reason or another will not practice abstinence or monogamy".

                                            The reason Dobson is attacking that message so specifically, with thewords "can"
                                            and "with impunity", is that as your point from the Surgeon General pointed out,
                                            it's incorrect. The idea that a condom reduces the chances of STD transmission,
                                            but does not prevent them, is not at all expressed in the succinct and catchy phrase
                                            "safe sex".</blockquote>
                                          <p>
                                            You can criticize the phrase "safe sex" on the grounds that no sex is completely
                                            safe, but it's Dobson who characterized the sexologists' position as one of advocating
                                            "safe sex".
                                            <blockquote>
                                              If anything, the safe sex proponents who reference the Surgeon General's statement
                                              are the ones making the straw man argument. The Surgeon General did not say that
                                              sex with a condom is safe, just that it is safer than sex without a condom, and
                                              that the only safe action is to not have sex or have a monogamous uninfected partner.
                                              Is it really a straw man to recharacterize someone's words in a way that is logically
                                              correct?</blockquote>

                                              You're right about what Koop said, so why didn't Dobson address himself to that
                                              instead of a bunch of unnamed "safe sex proponents"?
