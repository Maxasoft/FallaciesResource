    Quantifier-Shift Fallacy</h1>
  <strong>Alias:</strong> Illicit Quantifier Shift

  <h3>
    Form:</h3>
  <p>
    Every <strong>P</strong> bears the relation <strong>R</strong> to some <strong>Q</strong>.
    <br />
    Therefore, some <strong>Q</strong> bears the <a href="glossary.html#InverseOfRelation">
      inverse of relation</a> <strong>R</strong> to every <strong>P</strong>.
    <h3>
      Similar Validating Form:</h3>
    <p>
      Some <strong>Q</strong> bears the relation <strong>R</strong> to every <strong>P</strong>.
      <br />
      Therefore, every <strong>P</strong> bears the inverse of relation <strong>R</strong>
      to some <strong>Q</strong>.
      <h3>
        Example:</h3>
      <p>
        Every event must have a cause, that is, every event bears the effect relation to
        some other event, which is its cause.
        <br />
        Therefore, there must be a cause of every event, that is, some event bears the inverse
        of the effect relation&#151which is the cause relation&#151to every other event.
        This first cause is what we call "God".
        <h3>
          Counter-Example:</h3>
        <p>
          Everybody loves someone.
          <br />
          Therefore, there is somebody whom everyone loves. (Lucky person!)
          <h3>
            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            The phrase "quantifier-shift" refers to the two <a href="glossary.html#Quantifier">
              quantifier</a>s at the beginning of the <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a>
            and <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">conclusion</a> of <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
              argument</a>s of this form, namely, "every" and "some". "Shift" refers to the
            fact that the difference between the premiss and conclusion of this form of argument
            consists in a shift in the order&#151or, technically, the <a href="glossary.html#Scope">
              scope</a>&#151of the quantifiers. In the premiss, the <a href="glossary.html#UniversalQuant">
                universal quantifier</a>, "every", is followed by the <a href="glossary.html#ExistentialQuant">
                  existential</a> one, "some", whereas in the conclusion the order is reversed.
            This means that in the premiss the universal quantifier has widest scope, while
            in the conclusion the existential quantifier has wider scope.
            <p>
              The <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>ness of this form of argument
              is most easily seen by examining some <a href="glossary.html#CounterExample">counter-example</a>s
              that would fool no one. For instance, everyone has a mother&#151that is, for every
              person, there is some mother of that person. However, it is false that there is
              a mother of us all&#151that is, it is not true that some woman is the mother of
              everyone.
              <p>
                The converse inference is <a href="glossary.html#Validating">validating</a> (see
                the <strong>Similar Validating Form</strong>); for instance, if there was truly
                someone who loved everyone, then it would follow that everyone was loved by <em>someone</em>&#151namely,
                the all-lover. But it does not follow from the fact that everyone is loved by someone
                that there is someone who loves everyone&#151that is, an all-lover. The fact that
                these two inferences differ only in the direction in which the quantifiers are shifted
                is probably one psychological reason why this fallacy is so easy to commit.
