          Cheating by the Soviets
          <p>
            Barry Schweid of the Associated Press, in his efforts to criticize President Reagan's
            space-based defense against Soviet missiles, came up with a report from some Stanford
            University group that claimed to find little evidence of cheating by the Soviet
            Union on arms-control treaties.
            <p>
              Where were they when Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and George Shultz, secretary
              of state, and several members of our military forces went on TV and described and
              enumerated the different times and ways that the Soviet Union has cheated on the
              1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty?
              <p>
        Does Schweid really believe that the group at Stanford is more knowledgeable about
        U.S. arms-control policy than all our military experts, with Congress thrown in
        for good measure? If I thought that was true, I wouldn't sleep much tonight. And
        I doubt if he would either.</blockquote>

            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            We must often rely upon expert opinion when drawing <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
              conclusion</a>s about technical matters where we lack the time or expertise to
            form an informed opinion. For instance, those of us who are not physicians usually
            rely upon those who are when making medical decisions, and we are not wrong to do
            so. There are, however, four major ways in which such <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
              argument</a>s can go wrong:
            <ol>
              <li>An appeal to authority may be inappropriate in a couple of ways:
                <ul>
                  <li>It is unnecessary. If a question can be answered by observation or calculation,
                    an argument from authority is not needed. Since arguments from authority are weaker
                    than more direct evidence, go look or figure it out for yourself.
                    <p>
                      The renaissance rebellion against the authority of Aristotle and the <cite>Bible</cite>
                      played an important role in the scientific revolution. Aristotle was so respected
                      in the Middle Ages that his word was taken on empirical issues which were easily
                      decidable by observation. The scientific revolution moved away from this over-reliance
                      on authority towards the use of observation and experiment.
                      <p>
                        Similarly, the <cite>Bible</cite> has been invoked as an authority on empirical
                        or mathematical questions. A particularly amusing example is the claim that the
                        value of <em>pi</em> can be determined to be 3 based on certain passages in the
                        Old Testament. The value of <em>pi</em>, however, is a mathematical question which
                        can be answered by calculation, and appeal to authority is irrelevant.
                        <li>
                  It is impossible. About some issues there simply is no expert opinion, and an appeal
                  to authority is bound to commit the next type of mistake. For example, many self-help
                  books are written every year by self-proclaimed "experts" on matters for which there
                  is no expertise.</ul>
                <li>The "authority" cited is not an expert on the issue, that is, the person who supplies
                  the opinion is not an expert at all, or is one, but in an unrelated area. The now-classic
                  example is the old television commercial which began: "I'm not a doctor, but I play
                  one on TV...." The actor then proceeded to recommend a brand of medicine.
                  <li>The authority is an expert, but is not disinterested. That is, the expert is biased
                    towards one side of the issue, and his opinion is thereby untrustworthy.
                    <p>
                      For example, suppose that a medical scientist testifies that ambient cigarette smoke
                      does not pose a hazard to the health of non-smokers exposed to it. Suppose, further,
                      that it turns out that the scientist is an employee of a cigarette company. Clearly,
                      the scientist has a powerful bias in favor of the position that he is taking which
                      calls into question his objectivity.
                      <p>
                        There is an old saying: "A doctor who treats himself has a fool for a patient,"
                        and a similar version for attorneys: "A lawyer who defends himself has a fool for
                        a client." Why should these be true if the doctor or lawyer is an expert on medicine
                        or the law? The answer is that we are all biased in our own causes. A physician
                        who tries to diagnose his own illness is more likely to make a mistake out of <a
                          href="wishthnk.html">wishful thinking</a>, or out of fear, than another physician
                        would be.
                        <li>While the authority is an expert, his opinion is unrepresentative of expert opinion
                          on the subject. The fact is that if one looks hard enough, it is possible to find
                          an expert who supports virtually any position that one wishes to take. "Such is
                          human perversity", to quote Lewis Carroll. This is a great boon for debaters, who
                          can easily find expert opinion on their side of a question, whatever that side is,
                          but it is confusing for those of us listening to debates and trying to form an opinion.
                          <p>
                            Experts are human beings, after all, and human beings err, even in their area of
                            expertise. This is one reason why it is a good idea to get a second opinion about
                            major medical matters, and even a third if the first two disagree. While most people
                            understand the sense behind seeking a second opinion when their life or health is
                            at stake, they are frequently willing to accept a single, unrepresentative opinion
                            on other matters, especially when that opinion agrees with their own bias.
                            <p>
                              Bias (problem 3) is one source of unrepresentativeness. For instance, the opinions
                              of cigarette company scientists tend to be unrepresentative of expert opinion on
                              the health consequences of smoking because they are biased to minimize such consequences.
                              For the general problem of judging the opinion of a population based upon a sample,
                              see the <a href="biassamp.html">Fallacy of Unrepresentative Sample</a>
              .</ol>
            <p>
              To sum up these points in a positive manner, before relying upon expert opinion,
              go through the following checklist:
              <ul>
                <li>Is this a matter which I can decide without appeal to expert opinion? If the answer
                  is "yes", then do so. If "no", go to the next question:
                  <li>Is this a matter upon which expert opinion is available? If not, then your opinion
                    will be as good as anyone else's. If so, proceed to the next question:
                    <li>Is the authority an expert on the matter? If not, then why listen? If so, go on:
                      <li>Is the authority biased towards one side? If so, the authority may be untrustworthy.
                        At the very least, before accepting the authority's word seek a second, unbiased
                        opinion. That is, go to the last question:
                        <li>
                Is the authority's opinion representative of expert opinion? If not, then find out
                what the expert consensus is and rely on that. If so, then you may rationally rely
                upon the authority's opinion.</ul>
              <p>
                If an argument to authority cannot pass these five tests, then it commits the fallacy
                of appeal to misleading authority.
                <h3>
                  Exposure:</h3>
                <p>
                  Since not all arguments from expert opinion are <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">
                    fallacious</a>, some authorities on logic have taken to labelling this fallacy
                  as "appeal to <em>inappropriate</em> or <em>irrelevant</em> or <em>questionable</em>
                  authority", rather than the traditional name "appeal to authority". For the same
                  reason, I use the name "appeal to <em>misleading</em> authority" to distinguish
                  fallacious from non-fallacious arguments from authority.

                      A thought about the "Appeal to Misleading Authority" fallacy. In your section on
                      this fallacy, you propose a five-point checklist for determining if an appeal to
                      authority is appropriate. I would suggest a sixth: "Is there opinion available from
                      this expert on this subject?". In other words, does the authority actually support
                      the appeal, or are the authority's words being taken out of context or otherwise
                      misunderstood?</blockquote>
                    <p>
                      I have seen similar checklists for evaluating arguments from authority which include
                      such a point. However, there are two reasons why there is no such point on my list:
                      <ol>
                        <li>Certainly, when evaluating an appeal to authority for <a href="glossary.html#Cogency">
                          cogency</a>, the first step one should take is to verify that the authority is cited
                          correctly. If the authority's position is either misquoted, misrepresented, or misunderstood,
                          then the argument will be uncogent due to a false <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">
                            premiss</a>. However, having a false premiss is not, in my view, a logical fault,
                          but is a factual fault. Factual errors can be just as important as logical errors,
                          but they are distinct types of error.
                          <li>
                        Quoting out of context is a fallacy in its own right. It is uncommon to treat quoting
                        out of context as a separate fallacy, but I do so because it is a more common error
                        than a number of traditional fallacies. Because I treat it separately, I don't include
                        it in the checklist for appeal to misleading authority. However, it is true that
                        quoting out of context often occurs in appeals to authority, so it is something
                        to watch out for.</ol>

                          cabinet, and could be counted on to support his proposals. Similarly, members of
                          the armed forces are not encouraged to disagree with the Commander-In-Chief, especially
                          when the services stand to benefit from the proposal. The one exception in this
                          letter is Congress, which was controlled by the opposition party, but this evidence
                          is added as an afterthought and is difficult to assess. In contrast, the Stanford
                          University group cited by Schweid was disinterested, so far as we can tell from
                          the letter.

                            Some readers have suggested that the Stanford University group might be ideologically
                            biased against a space-based missile defense. However, even if true&#151and there
                            is no evidence from the letter that it is&#151members of the administration were
                            likely to be ideologically biased in <em>favor</em> of such a system. So, ideological
                            bias is a tie between the two sources. The problem with the administration authorities
                            is not ideological bias, but institutional bias in favor of an employer. The Stanford
                            University group lacks that kind of bias.

                              <li>"The analysis author misses a few critical points, specifically the question of
                                'Is the authority an expert on the matter? If not, then why listen?' and 'Is the
                                authority's opinion representative of expert opinion?,' focusing only on the fourth
                                item on your checklist, the matter of bias. The writer in the example given specifically
                                asks why one should consider the Stanford Group (who is not named specifically,
                                nor their members described, unfortunately) to be more 'expert' than a few different
                                branches of the US government. As such, he ignores the writer's argument and attempts
                                to make it one of bias, which is all well and good assuming that one considers both
                                Stanford and the US government equally expert on the topic of Soviet weapon practices.

                                  "This is one of my pet peeves considering how often one sees on TV and in print
                                  'That man is biased, thus his word cannot be trusted even though he is a noted researcher
                                  in the field. This layman, however, is perfectly innocent, and happens to agree
                                  with me, so let's listen to him.' Particularly since it presumes that any interest
                                  begets bias enough to spin falsehoods, and that someone can do all sorts of fact
                                  finding and research without being the least interested (in the bias sense) in their
                                  theories. In other words, people argue over who is getting paid by whom, not actual
                                  facts or data."&#8213;Eric J. Hammer

                                    You're right that we don't know anything from the letter about the Stanford group
                                    other than that they were from Stanford and they were a group. It's possible that
                                    they were a group of Stanford students or, more likely, a politicized group of Stanford
                                    faculty who were opining outside of their areas of expertise. However, the point
                                    of the example is not that the Stanford group was correct or should be believed,
                                    but that the letter to the editor makes a poor argument against them. If the Stanford
                                    group were in fact unqualified, or were not disinterested, then the letter writer
                                    should have challenged their qualifications or disinterestedness, rather than citing
                                    other experts who were clearly not disinterested.
                                    <li>"I think this is missing from your checklist: If the military is wrong about an
                                      opinion such as 'the Soviets are cheating' bad things happen to the military (careers
                                      ruined, etc.). If the Stanford group is wrong, nothing bad happens to Stanford.
                                      So when giving an opinion the military risks a lot of prestige but Stanford risks
                                      nothing. What this boils down to is the military would be held accountable where
                                      Stanford would not. This seems like it would be a separate checklist question. Because
                                      if someone is very accountable it would make an expert opinion more important."&#8213;Mitch
                                      Hunt

                                        Accountability is certainly something to think about when evaluating expert opinion,
                                        especially when trying to decide between "dueling experts". That said, I don't see
                                        why accountability would be all on one side in the example. If the Stanford group
                                        were publicly shown to be wrong, then that could damage its reputation, the reputations
                                        of its individual members, as well as the reputation of Stanford University by association.
                                        <p>
                              Moreover, the accountability of the military is a two-edged sword. The military
                              is ultimately accountable to the civilian government, specifically the executive
                              branch, and the head of that branch is also the Commander-in-Chief. So, a military
                              career could certainly be ruined by taking a public position in opposition to the
                              President's stated policy. In this case, I think that the issue of accountability
                              gives additional support to the Stanford group.</ul>
