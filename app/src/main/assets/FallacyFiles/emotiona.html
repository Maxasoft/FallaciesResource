    Emotional Appeal</h1>

    Exposition:</h3>
  <p>
    An appeal to emotion is a type of <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>
    which attempts to arouse the emotions of its audience in order to gain acceptance
    of its <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">conclusion</a>. Despite the example of
    Mr. Spock from the original <cite>Star Trek</cite> television series, emotion is
    not always out of place in logical thinking. However, there is no doubt that strong
    emotions can subvert rational thought, and playing upon emotions in an argument
    is often <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>.
    <p>
      When are appeals to emotion appropriate, and when are they fallacious? No student
      would attempt to prove a mathematical theorem by playing upon the teacher's sympathy
      for the long hours of hard work put into it. Such an appeal would be obviously irrelevant,
      since either the proof is correct or it is flawed, despite the student's best efforts.
      In contrast, if the teacher attempts to motivate the student to work on proving
      the theorem by invoking the specter of a failing grade, this appeal to fear is not
      irrelevant.
      <p>
        So, one distinction between relevant and fallacious appeals to emotion is based
        on the distinction between arguments which aim to motivate us to action, and those
        which are intended to convince us to believe something. Appeals to emotion are always
        fallacious when intended to influence our beliefs, but they are sometimes reasonable
        when they aim to motivate us to act. The fact that we desire something to be true
        gives not the slightest reason to believe it, and the fact that we fear something
        being true is no reason to think it false; but the desire for something is often
        a good reason to pursue it, and fear of something else a good reason to flee.
        <p>
          Even when appeals to emotion aim at motivating us, there is still a way that they
          may fail to be rational, namely, when what we are being persuaded to do has insufficient
          connection with what is arousing our emotion. For instance, a familiar type of emotional
          appeal is the appeal to pity or sympathy, which is used by many charities. Photographs
          of crippled or hungry children are shown in order to arouse one's desire to help
          them, with the charity trying to motivate you to write a check. However, there may
          be little or no connection between your check and the poor children you wish to
          help. Certainly, your money will probably not help the <em>specific</em> children
          you see in such appeals. At best, it may go to help some <em>similar</em> children
          who need help. At worst, it may go into further fundraising efforts, and into the
          pockets of the people who work for the charity.
          <p>
            In such cases, what is needed is an argument that there is a causal connection between
            the action motivated by emotion and the circumstances that arouse that emotion.
            Will writing a check help the pitiful children? Will voting for this candidate help
            prevent frightening circumstances? If all that a charity or candidate does is arouse
            emotions, that is no reason to give them money or votes. When we feel strong emotions,
            we want to do <em>some</em>thing, but we need good reasons to believe that the something
            we do will be effective.
