  <h3>
    Etymology:</h3>
  <img src="http://fallacyfiles.org/Magritte3.jpg" alt="Les Charmes du Paysage" border="0"
    align="right">
  <p>
    The Texas sharpshooter is a fabled marksman who fires his gun randomly at the side
    of a barn, then paints a bullseye around the spot where the most bullet holes cluster.
    The story of this Lone Star state shooter has given its name to a fallacy apparently
    first described in the field of epidemiology, which studies how cases of disease
    cluster in a population.
    <h3>
      Example:</h3>
    <p>
      The number of cases of disease <strong>D</strong> in city <strong>C</strong> is
      greater than would be expected by chance. City <strong>C</strong> has a factory
      which has released amounts of chemical agent <strong>A</strong> into the environment.
      Therefore, agent <strong>A</strong> causes disease <strong>D</strong>.

      <h3>
        Exposition:</h3>
      <p>
        This fallacy occurs when someone jumps to the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion"
          title="In an argument, the proposition that is argued for.">conclusion</a> that
        a cluster in some data must be the result of a cause, usually one that it is clustered
        around. There are two reasons why this is <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious" title="Committing a logical fallacy.">
          fallacious</a>:
        <ol>
          <li>The cluster may well be the result of chance, in which case it was not caused
            by anything.
            <li>Even if the cluster is not the result of chance, there are other possible reasons
              for the clustering, other than the cause chosen. For instance, in the <strong>Example</strong>,
              if disease <strong>D</strong>
          is contagious, it may be clustering around some person who carried it into the city.</ol>
        <p>
          At best, the occurrence of a cluster in the data is the basis not for a causal conclusion,
          but for the formation of a causal hypothesis which needs to be tested. Patterns
          in data can be useful for forming hypotheses, but they are not themselves sufficient
          evidence of a causal connection. In short, correlation is not causation.
          <h3>
            Exposure:</h3>
          <p>
            This fallacy lives up to its striking name because the Texas sharpshooter takes
            a random cluster, and by drawing a target onto it makes it appear to be causally
            determined, as if the Texan were shooting at the target. Similarly, when looking
            at data, there is a danger of jumping to a conclusion that a random cluster is a
            causal pattern. Without further testing, such a conclusion is seldom if ever justified.
