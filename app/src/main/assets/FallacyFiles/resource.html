              <p>
                From Charles Ess, a professor of religion and philosophy, comes this collection
                of 28 files on standard fallacies. It is based on his <cite>A Database of Informal
                  Fallacies</cite> (1987), and consists mainly of examples, though some of the files
                are empty. Despite the title, there are a few formal fallacies covered. Also, since
                most of the files on individual fallacies contain no or little explanatory matter,
                this is not the best place to start out studying the fallacies. Complicating the
                situation even further is the fact that some nonfallacious examples are included,
                along with a "fallacy" which is no such thing, with no indication of which are supposed
                to be fallacious and which not. So, these files would seem to be of most use to
                someone wanting to test their understanding on a number of examples, with some ringers
                thrown in. Disappointingly, most of the examples are anecdotal, reconstructed from
                memory, or invented: there are few direct quotations, and no citations to allow
                one to examine the examples in their own words in context.

                  <p>
        By Fergus Duniho. A JavaScript program which randomly generates a categorical syllogism,
        and allows one to test it for fallacies. Since a randomly generated syllogism is
        more likely to be invalid than valid, this is a good test of fallacy spotting. The
        program also comes with a clear, brief tutorial on syllogisms and their fallacies.</ul>

        <p>
          By Bradley Dowden. An article from the <cite>Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</cite>,
          written by one of the two editors of that reference work. Consists of a short introductory
          discussion of the scholarly controversies over fallacies, followed by a long list
          of named fallacies. There are 164 names of fallacies, though many of the fallacies
          have multiple names. I count 103 fallacies with substantive entries, though necessarily
          each entry is brief since the entire article is one long webpage! Unfortunately,
          the examples given are either short cooked-up ones, or the typical textbook chestnuts.
          If you can't find a fallacy listed in the <cite>Fallacy Files</cite>, this would
          be the most likely place to find a short but sound explanation of it on the web.
