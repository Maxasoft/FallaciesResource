      The operation cost just under $500, and no one was killed, or even hurt. In that
      same time the Pentagon spent tens of millions of dollars and dropped tens of thousands
      of pounds of explosives on Viet Nam, killing or wounding thousands of human beings,
      causing hundreds of millions of dollars of damage. Because nothing justified their
      actions in our calculus, nothing could contradict the merit of ours.</blockquote>

          Exposition:</h3>
        <p>
          This fallacy involves the attempt to justify a wrong action by pointing to another
          wrong action. Often, the other wrong action is of the same type or committed by
          the accuser, in which case it is the <a href="glossary.html#Subfallacy">subfallacy</a>
          <a href="tuquoque.html">Tu Quoque</a>. Attempting to justify committing a wrong
          on the grounds that someone else is guilty of another wrong is clearly a Red Herring,
          because if this form of argument were <a href="glossary.html#Cogent">cogent</a>,
          one could justify <em>anything</em>&#8213;always assuming that there is another
          wrong to point to, which is a very safe assumption.
          <h3>
            Exposure:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Why do people think that two wrongs add up to one right? This is speculation,
              but perhaps they are misled by the logical fact that two <a href="glossary.html#Negation">
                negation</a>s cancel out, or the similar mathematical fact that two negative numbers
              when multiplied produce a positive number. It is common to think of wrongs as morally
              "negative", but this is distinct from the logical notion of negation and the mathematical
              notion of negative number. Thus, the analogy between moral negatives and logico-mathematical
              negatives is a poor one based on equivocation on the word "negative".
              <li>
            Two Wrongs Make a Right needs to be distinguished from retaliation or punishment,
            as it would not do to condemn these on logical grounds, though they may be morally
            objectionable. So, when children defend themselves by hitting or kicking another
            child, they may be morally to blame but not logically. If a parent spanks a child
            for hitting another child, this may be bad parenting, but it is not a logical mistake.
            Punishment, or retribution, is behavior aimed at modifying behavior, not argument.</ul>

              <p>
                This is a very clear example of the fallacy. The terrorists tried to justify bombing
                the Pentagon on the grounds that the Pentagon had unjustifiably bombed Viet Nam.
                The gist of the fallacy is contained in the last sentence, which claims that the
                wrongness of the Pentagon's actions justified a similar wrong: "Wrong + wrong =
                right."

                <p>
                  Alert reader Ken Smith sent in the following correction of the <cite>National Lampoon</cite>
                  quote:
                  <blockquote>
                    The quotation from National Lampoon's "Deteriorata" that you list on your page is
                    incorrect. The word "lefts" does not appear in the text at all. As spoken by Norman
                    Rose on the album, which I have in front of me and playing, the words go:
                    <blockquote>
                      Consider that two wrongs never make a right, but that three <em>do</em>.</blockquote>
                    <p>
                    I've seen this misrepresentation in other places on the web; it must have been made
                    by people who have never actually heard the recording (considering its scarcity
                    on vinyl, and that it has not been issued on CD.).</blockquote>
                  <p>
                    It's a shame, because the "lefts" version is more clever. Also, it puns on two meanings
                    of "right", which is an example of a funny <a href="equivoqu.html">equivocation</a>.
                    Thanks to Ken, though, for the correction.
