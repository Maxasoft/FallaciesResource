            This book offers some guidelines for thinking critically about social statistics.
            It identifies some common problems with social statistics and illustrates them with
            specific examples. It is often easier to understand a particular example than to
            understand and recognize the general problem or principle that the example illustrates.
            Still, I hope that, having read this book, you [will] become more familiar with
            some of the most common flaws that bedevil social statistics; that you can ask some
            basic questions about a statistic's origins (definition, measurement, sampling,
            and the other issues covered in chapter 2); that you are familiar with some of the
            ways that statistics can be mangled (chapter 3); that you understand the risks of
            inappropriate comparisons (chapter 4); and that you can do more than simply throw
            up your hands when confronted with a debate featuring competing statistics (chapter
            5). (Pp. 161-162)</blockquote>

            <p>
              Joel Best is a sociologist and, as a result, this is not a book about the mathematics
              of statistics, but about its sociology. That is, it's about the ways in which bad
              statistics are generated and spread through society.
              <p>
                People tend to accept statistics as facts, but all statistics are created by people,
                and many of those people have agendas. Social statistics&#8213;statistics about
                social problems, such as prostitution or suicide&#8213;are often produced by activists
                who are concerned about the problem, and may exaggerate it. When not produced by
                activists, statistics are often a product of government, which may be motivated
                in the opposite direction of the activists, namely, to play down a problem.
                <p>
                  Given that statistics are created by people, there are three questions that should
                  be asked about them, according to Best:
                  <ol>
                    <li>Who created the statistic? (P. 27)
                      <li>Why was the statistic created? (P. 28)
                        <li>
                    How was the statistic created?</ol>
                  <p>
                    Answering questions 1 and 2 may give reasons to doubt the statistic's accuracy,
                    if the source has a motive for exaggerating or downplaying it (1), or if it was
                    created to advance a particular cause or to sell a product (2). Also, if you can
                    answer the first two questions, you may be able to allow for the bias of a statistic.
                    In contrast, learning that the source was unbiased should increase your confidence
                    in the statistic.
                    <p>
                      However, most of the book concerns question 3, that is, the way in which flawed
                      statistics are produced. There are four main ways that people come up with bad statistics,
                      according to Best (Ch. 2):
                      <ol>
                        <li><strong>Guessing (p. 32)</strong>: Guessing about social statistics is more common
                          than you might think. Social problems that have been ignored or are hard to count&#8213;such
                          as rape, prostitution, homosexuality, AIDS, etc.&#8213;have a "dark figure", that
                          is, a number of cases that are not counted for various reasons, including embarrassment
                          or fear of arrest. So, when activists or bureaucrats are called upon by reporters
                          to estimate the size of a problem, they may have to guess.
                          <li><strong>Bad Definitions (p. 39)</strong>: Most social problems are <a href="glossary.html#Vague"
                            title="Having borderline cases.">vague</a>, for instance, child abuse: non-abusive
                            treatment of children gradually shades over into abusive beatings or neglect. In
                            order to count instances of child abuse, decisions must be made about whether to
                            include or exclude borderline cases. Those who wish to call attention to the problem
                            are motivated to include borderline cases, while those who want to ignore it will
                            exclude those same cases. Both sides may claim to be counting incidents of "child
                            abuse", though they come up with different numbers.
                            <p>
                              Also, activists tend to pick extreme examples to publicize a problem (p. 56). Such
                              examples are selected because they are not typical of the problem, yet they may
                              mislead people into committing the Anecdotal Fallacy. For example, in order to call
                              attention to the problem of child abuse, activists may point to a case of murder,
                              though neglect is a more typical form of abuse.
                              <li><strong>Flawed Measurement (pp. 45-52)</strong>: Flawed measurement can come about
                                through badly-worded survey questions, for instance. However, if I have one criticism
                                of this book, it is that Best's main illustration of the problem of flawed measurement
                                is "poverty". While there are doubtlessly measurement problems involved in counting
                                the poor, Best's discussion centers on a definition problem, and thus belongs under
                                the previous heading. "Poverty" is a vague concept, which leads to all of the problems
                                mentioned above of counting the number of cases of vague concepts, and of <a href="glossary.html#ContraryProps"
                                  title="At least one is false.">contrary</a> definitions used by those with competing
                                interests, so well explained by Best in the rest of the book.
                                <li><strong>Weak Sampling (p. 52)</strong>: Poor sampling takes two forms:
                                  <ol>
                                    <li>Samples that are too small: See the entry for Hasty Generalization.
                                      <li>
                                    Unrepresentative Samples: See the entry of the same name.</ol>
                                  <p>
                        Another all too common source of weak samples is what's known as "convenience sampling"
                        (p. 55): a convenience sample is a nonrandom, "unscientific" sample that is drawn
                        in whatever way is most convenient. Such samples are cheap and easy, which is what
                        makes them "convenient", and also what makes them attractive to the media or interest
                        groups. However, the most convenient sample is likely to be unrepresentative of
                        the larger population. When you read that a poll is "scientific" that means that
                        it was conducted using random sampling, as opposed to convenience sampling.</ol>
                      <p>
                        Even when all of these pitfalls have been avoided and good statistics produced,
                        there are still what Best calls "mutant statistics". These are numbers that have
                        been reported and passed from person to person, mutating in the process, as in the
                        game of "telephone". Such mutations can come about through incorrect generalizations,
                        misinterpretation, or misunderstanding. For example, an estimate that 150,000 American
                        women had anorexia mutated into the claim that that many women died of anorexia
                        each year (pp. 63-64).
                        <p>
                          Finally, there is the "apples to oranges" comparison. One of the most common such
                          comparisons is the comparing of prices at different times. Because of inflation,
                          money tends to lose value over time, which means that comparing the price of, say,
                          a gallon of gasoline today with one ten years ago is an "apples to oranges" comparison.
                          To compare apples to apples or oranges to oranges, monetary comparisons need to
                          take inflation into account.
                          <p>
                            "Stat wars" occur when competing interests advance contrary statistics for a problem
                            and attack each others numbers. It's hard to untangle the statistics bandied about
                            in the press by activists and politicians during such wars, because the media often
                            just report the different numbers without attempting to figure out which are right,
                            leaving most of their readers in the dark (p. 137). Of course, if different sides
                            are using contrary definitions of a problem, then each side's numbers may be right;
                            but this won't be obvious if the different definitions are not reported, as is often
                            the case. Luckily, in the years since Best's book was published, there are a number
                            of new media outlets that look critically at statistics, such as <cite>The Wall Street
                              Journal</cite>'s "Numbers Guy", and <cite>Annenberg Political Fact Check</cite>.
                            <p>
                              The final chapter (ch. 6) discusses four mindsets towards social statistics:
                              <ol>
                                <li>Awestruck (p. 162): Treating statistics as unchallengable facts.
                                  <li>Naive (p. 162): This is where most of us are.
                                    <li>Cynical (p. 164): The cynical treat all statistics as "damned lies" and reject
                                      them without due consideration. Also, from the ranks of the cynics come some of
                                      the worst statistical abuses.
                                      <li>
                                Critical (p. 166): A critical mindset does not swallow all statistics whole&#8213;as
                                the awestruck do&#8213;nor does it reject them all without thought&#8213;as the
                                cynics do.</ol>
                              <p>
                                These same mindsets apply more generally to argumentation. One of the dangers of
                                a book such as this is that learning about misleading statistics may lead to a cynical
                                dismissal of all statistics. Similarly, learning about logical fallacies may lead
                                to the rejection of all argumentation as untrustworthy. Like Best, I hope that my
                                readers will not turn into cynics but into critics.
                                <p>
                                  The title of this book is, of course, taken from the cynical phrase "lies, damned
                                  lies, and statistics", which is usually interpreted as grouping statistics with
                                  lies. Perhaps a more apt, more critical title would come from the phrase: "figures
                                  don't lie, but liars can figure". Despite its cynical title, Best's book is one
                                  of the best ways to learn how to cease being awestruck by statistics and to start
                                  critically evaluating them.

                                                  <p>
                                                    The Universe obeys what's called the "Law of Attraction". No, it's not gravity,
                                                    nor is it magnetism, though the book likes to use these forces as metaphors and
                                                    blurs the distinction between them. Rather the "Law of Attraction" is the notion
                                                    that good thoughts attract good things and bad thoughts attract bad things. So,
                                                    if you want a ham sandwich, all that you have to do is think that you <em>have</em>
                                                    a ham sandwich, and the Universe will so arrange itself that you <em>will</em> have
                                                    a ham sandwich, without having to do anything tiresome like go to the fridge. In
                                                    other words, the Law of Attraction is a pseudoscientific euphemism for wishful thinking.
                                                    <p>
                                                      The Law of Attraction is just a version of the old idea of "positive thinking".
                                                      Think happy thoughts and happy things will happen to you; think sad thoughts and
                                                      the Universe will give you something to be sad about. However, there's one catch
                                                      to the Law: you have to be careful what you wish for because the Universe is an
                                                      idiot. The Universe will grant your every whim, but it doesn't understand <a href="glossary.html#Negation"

                                                      wish: "I don't want basal cell carcinoma", the stupid Universe understands you to
                                                      say: "I want basal cell carcinoma", and gives it to you. So, the proper way to engage
                                                      in wishful thinking is never to use a negative. "I want clear, healthy skin", is
                                                      what you should wish for.
                                                      <p>
                                                        Why doesn't the Universe understand negation? The Law of Attraction is that positive
                                                        thoughts attract positive things and negative thoughts attract negative things,
                                                        but the word "negative" is <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguous" title="Having more than one meaning.">
                                                          ambiguous</a> because it can mean either of two things:
                                                        <ol>
                                                          <li>Bad or harmful. Antonym: Positive
                                                            <li>
                                                          Having to do with logical negation. Antonym: Affirmative</ol>
                                                        <p>
                                                          The Universe, according to Byrne, can't understand the difference between these
                                                          two ideas, though I suspect that the real reason is that Byrne herself doesn't understand
                                                          it. Of course, if it weren't for this claim, the Law of Attraction would be even
                                                          more obviously false than it already is. Since there's no evidence given in the
                                                          book to believe that the Universe is so stupid as not to understand negation, the
                                                          only explanation I can think of for this strange claim is that it's an <a href="glossary.html#AdHocHyp">

                                                          all, anyone who isn't delusional will look around them and immediately realize that
                                                          the world does not automatically conform itself to our whims; that the Universe
                                                          misunderstands our wishes and keeps sending us things that we don't want helps explain
                                                          wars, famines, and pestilences.

                                                            money. If you could get things just by wishing for them, what would you need money
                                                            for? Here's Byrne's startling explanation of the spiritual significance of wealth:
