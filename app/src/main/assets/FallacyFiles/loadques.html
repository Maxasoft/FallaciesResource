            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            A "loaded question", like a loaded gun, is a dangerous thing. A loaded question
            is a question with a false or questionable presupposition, and it is "loaded" with
            that presumption. The question <em>"Have you stopped beating your wife?"</em> presupposes
            that you have beaten your wife prior to its asking, as well as that you <em>have</em>
            a wife. If you are unmarried, or have never beaten your wife, then the question
            is loaded.
            <p>
              Since this example is a yes/no question, there are only the following two direct
              answers:
              <ol>
                <li>"Yes, I have stopped beating my wife", which entails "I <em>was</em> beating my
                  wife."
                  <li>"No, I haven't stopped beating my wife", which entails "I am <em>still</em>
                beating my wife."</ol>
              <p>
                Thus, either direct answer entails that you have beaten your wife, which is, therefore,
                a presupposition of the question. So, a loaded question is one which you cannot
                answer directly without implying a falsehood or a statement that you deny. For this
                reason, the proper response to such a question is not to answer it directly, but
                to either refuse to answer or to reject the question.
                <p>
                  Some systems of parliamentary debate provide for "dividing the question", that is,
                  splitting a complex question up into two or more simple questions. Such a move can
                  be used to split the example as follows:
                  <ol>
                    <li>"Have you ever beaten your wife?"
                      <li>
                    "If so, are you still doing so?"</ol>
                  <p>
                    In this way, <strong>1</strong> can be answered directly by "no", and then the conditional
                    question <strong>2</strong> does not arise.
                    <h3>
                      Exposure:</h3>
                    <p>
                      Since a question is not an <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>, simply
                      asking a loaded question is not a <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious"><em>fallacious</em></a>
                      argument. Rather, loaded questions are typically used to trick someone into implying
                      something they did not intend. For instance, salespeople learn to ask such loaded
                      questions as: "Will that be cash or charge?" This question gives only two alternatives,
                      thus presuming that the potential buyer has already decided to make a purchase,
                      which is similar to the <a href="eitheror.html">Black-or-White Fallacy</a>. If the
                      potential buyer answers the question directly, he may suddenly find himself an <em>
                        actual</em> buyer.

                        This is a series of loaded questions and it illustrates one of the common uses of
                        the loaded question as a rhetorical device, namely, innuendo. The questions come
                        at the end of the article, and presuppose the following controversial claims:
                        <ul>
                          <li>The American government did something to bring about the terrorist attacks.
                            <li>The public doesn't learn anything from the press about that government's mistakes.
                              <li>The public is not learning about what's happening in Afghanistan.
                                <li>Central Asia's oil reserves are somehow pertinent.
                                  <li>
                          There are some unspecified links between the Bush and bin Laden families.</ul>
                        <p>
                          No evidence is given in the article for any of these claims. Loaded questions are
                          used in this way to slip claims into rhetoric without the burden of proving them,
                          or the necessity of taking responsibility for unproven assertions.

                          <p>
                            Reader Steven Flintham asks the following unloaded question:
                            <p>
                              <strong>Q:</strong> "I've just been browsing your site and the page on loaded questions
                              reminded me of something I came across ages ago without ever getting quite clear
                              in my mind. Although it <em>looks</em> misleading, if I don't have a wife or have
                              never beaten my wife, isn't it strictly accurate to answer 'No' to the question
                              'Have you stopped beating your wife?'? I haven't stopped, after all&#151I never
                              even started."
                              <p>
                                <strong>A:</strong> The answer to your question turns upon an important subtlety
                                about presupposition. Putting aside the unpleasant example of wife-beating, let's
                                use as an example the type of question: "Have you stopped <strong>X</strong>ing?"&#151it
                                doesn't matter what <strong>X</strong> is. This question is equivalent to saying:
                                "You have stopped <strong>X</strong>ing: yes or no?"
                                <p>
                                  Consider the contained <a href="glossary.html#Proposition">proposition</a>: "You
                                  have stopped <strong>X</strong>ing". Clearly, this means: "You have <strong>X</strong>ed
                                  and you are not now <strong>X</strong>ing." However, these two <a href="glossary.html#Conjunct">
                                    conjunct</a>s are not equal: the first conjunct is a presupposition of the question.
                                  A presupposition to a question is a proposition which is normally known to be true
                                  before the question is asked.
                                  <p>
                                    Given that our example question is a yes-no question, there are two direct answers
                                    that we can give it:
                                    <ol>
                                      <li>"Yes": "I have stopped <strong>X</strong>ing" or, equivalently, "I have <strong>
                                        X</strong>ed and I am not now <strong>X</strong>ing." Obviously, this implies "I
                                        have <strong>X</strong>ed."
                                        <li>"No": "It is not the case that I have stopped <strong>X</strong>ing" or, equivalently,
                                          "It is not the case that both I have <strong>X</strong>ed and I am not now <strong>
                                            X</strong>ing." This implies: "Either I have not <strong>X</strong>ed or I am
                                          now <strong>X</strong>ing." In other words, there are two bases for answering "no"
                                          to the question:
                                          <ul>
                                            <li>You have never <strong>X</strong>ed.
                                              <li>You are now <strong>X</strong>ing.</ul>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>
                                      So, you are right, Steven, that you could answer the loaded question "Have you stopped
                                      <strong>X</strong>ing?" with "No", because you have never <strong>X</strong>ed.
                                      However, this answer has a kind of ambiguity, since it leaves it open as to whether
                                      you are saying that you have never <strong>X</strong>ed or that you are still doing
                                      so. This is why it is misleading to simply answer "no" and leave it at that; one
                                      should at least say, instead: "No, I've never <strong>X</strong>ed so I can't very
                                      well stop."
                                      <p>
                                        However, since the proposition that you have <strong>X</strong>ed is a presupposition
                                        of the question, we normally presume that it is true or the question would not arise.
                                        This leaves as the only possible reason for denying the question that you are <em>
                                          still</em> <strong>X</strong>ing. This is why the second direct answer also commits
                                        you to <strong>X</strong>ing, though it does not logically imply it by itself. Rather,
                                        it implies it when taken together with the presupposition.
                                        <p>
                                          This is why loaded questions as a fallacy are sometimes classified as a type of
                                          question-begging. By loading some controversial or even false presupposition into
                                          the question, the unscrupulous questioner tries to sneak it in unchallenged.
                                          <p>
                                            Thanks for a difficult question, Steven!

                                              Reader Doug Merritt raises the following objection:
                                              <blockquote>
                                                You overlooked something important when you said, "Since a question is not an argument,
                                                simply asking a loaded question is not a fallacious argument." Loaded questions
                                                are, as you said, rhetorical devices, but in particular they are "rhetorical questions",
                                                and a rhetorical question is a form of <em>statement</em> that is merely phrased
                                                superficially as a question; it is not a true question. So I strongly disagree that
                                                a loaded question is not an argument. It is just as much of a (fallacious) argument
                                                as all the other categories in your taxonomy. This isn't merely splitting hairs;
                                                a debate can be won (in the view of the audience) by someone who does nothing at
                                                all but pose loaded questions; each serves to presume things for which no logical

                                                Even if you're right, Doug, that a loaded question is not really a question, but
                                                is a <a href="glossary.html#Statement">statement</a>, then it's still not an argument
                                                by itself. A loaded question is often a way of rhetorically making a statement,
                                                but it is grammatically a question. You will notice that as a logical fallacy it
                                                is in a category by itself, as can be seen in the <a href="taxonomy.html">Taxonomy
                                                  of Logical Fallacies</a>. This is because Loaded Question is a fallacy of questioning,
                                                as opposed to arguing. So, I don't disagree with you that asking loaded questions
                                                can be a powerful and fallacious rhetorical trick. Rather, I simply think that fallacies
                                                involving questions should be classified as a different type of fallacy than those
                                                involving arguments. I hope eventually to add further fallacies of questioning,
                                                so that Loaded Question will no longer be in a class by itself. In the meantime,
                                                the first chapter of Fischer's book, listed in the Resources above, concerns eleven
