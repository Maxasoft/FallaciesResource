  <strong>Alias:</strong> False Conversion

    Example:</h3>
  <blockquote>
    We like the beautiful and don't like the ugly; therefore, what we like is beautiful,
    and what we don't like ugly&#8230;.</blockquote>

        Conversion is a <a href="glossary.html#Validating" title="One whose every instance is valid.">
          validating</a> form of <a href="glossary.html#ImmediateInference" title="An argument with only one premiss.">
            immediate inference</a> for <a href="glossary.html#Eproposition" title="A proposition of the form: No S are P.">

                  categorical proposition</a>s. To convert such a proposition is to switch
        the subject and predicate <a href="glossary.html#Term" title="A word or phrase that can be used to refer to a class of things.">
          term</a>s of the proposition, which is non-validating for the <a href="glossary.html#Aproposition"

              title="A proposition of the form: Some S are not P.">O-type proposition</a>s.
        Hence, the fallacy of Illicit Conversion is converting an A- or O-type proposition.

            <a name="Analysis"><strong>Analysis of the Example:</strong></a> This is really
            two <a href="glossary.html#Argument" title="A unit of reasoning consisting of propositions.">
              argument</a>s, both of which have the same general form, packed into one:
            <ol>
              <li>We like the beautiful, therefore what we like is beautiful.
                <li>
              We don't like the ugly, therefore what we don't like is ugly.</ol>
            <p>
              "We like the beautiful" means that whatever is beautiful we like. In other, more
              stilted, words: all beautiful things are things that we like. In contrast, "what
              we like is beautiful" means that whatever we like is beautiful, that is, all things
              that we like are beautiful things. So, the first argument reworded is:
              <p>
                All beautiful things are things that we like.
                <br />
                Therefore, all things that we like are beautiful things.

                  Clearly, this argument commits an illicit conversion. The in<a href="glossary.html#Valid"
                    title="Not necessarily having a true conclusion when the premisses are true.">valid</a>ity
                  of the argument may have been concealed from Ives by the confusingly similar wording
                  of the <a href="glossary.html#Premiss" title="A proposition in an argument that supplies evidence.">
                    premiss</a> and <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion" title="The proposition in an argument for which evidence is given.">
                      conclusion</a>. Analogous considerations apply to the second argument.
