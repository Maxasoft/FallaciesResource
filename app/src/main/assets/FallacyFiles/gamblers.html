  <h3>
    Form:</h3>
  <p>
    A fair gambling device has produced a "run".</p>
  <br />
  Therefore, on the next trial of the device, it is less likely than chance to continue
  the run.
  <h3>
    Example:</h3>
  <blockquote>
    On August 18, 1913, at the casino in Monte Carlo, black came up a record twenty-six
    times in succession [in roulette]. &#8230; [There] was a near-panicky rush to bet
    on red, beginning about the time black had come up a phenomenal fifteen times. In
    application of the maturity [of the chances] doctrine, players doubled and tripled
    their stakes, this doctrine leading them to believe after black came up the twentieth
    time that there was not a chance in a million of another repeat. In the end the
    unusual run enriched the Casino by some millions of francs.</blockquote>

  <h3>
    Exposition:</h3>
  <p>
    The Gambler's Fallacy and its sibling, <a href="hothandf.html">the Hot Hand Fallacy</a>,
    have two distinctions that can be claimed of no other fallacies:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>They have built a city in the desert: Las Vegas.</li>
    <li>They are the economic mainstay of Monaco, an entire, albeit tiny, country, from
      which we get the alias "Monte Carlo" fallacy.</li></ol>
  <p>
    Both fallacies are based on the same mistake, namely, a failure to understand statistical
    independence. Two events are statistically independent when the occurrence of one
    has no statistical effect upon the occurrence of the other. Statistical independence
    is connected to the notion of randomness in the following way: what makes a sequence
    random is that its members are statistically independent of each other. For instance,
    a list of random numbers is such that one cannot predict better than chance any
    member of the list based upon a knowledge of the other list members.</p>
  <p>
    To understand statistical independence, try the following experiment. Predict the
    next member of each of the two following sequences:</p>
  <p>
    2, 3, 5, 7, __
    <br />
    1, 8, 6, 7, __</p>
  <p>
    The first is the beginning of the sequence of prime numbers. The second is a random
    sequence gathered from the last digits of the first four numbers in a phone book.
    The first sequence is non-random, and predictable if one knows the way that it is
    generated. The second sequence is random and unpredictable&#151unless, of course,
    you look in the phone book, but that is not <em>prediction</em>, that is just looking
    at the sequence&#151because there is no underlying pattern to the sequence of last
    digits of telephone numbers in a phone book. The numbers in the second sequence
    are statistically independent.</p>
  <p>
    Many gambling games are based upon randomly-generated, statistically independent
    sequences, such as the series of numbers generated by a roulette wheel, or by throws
    of unloaded dice. A fair coin produces a random sequence of "heads" or "tails",
    that is, each flip of the coin is statistically independent of all the other flips.
    This is what is meant by saying that the coin is "fair", namely, that it is not
    biased in such a way as to produce a predictable sequence.</p>
  <p>
    Consider the Example: If the roulette wheel at the Casino was fair, then the probability
    of the ball landing on black was a little less than one-half on any given turn of
    the wheel. Also, since the wheel is fair, the colors that come up are statistically
    independent of one another, thus no matter how many times the ball has fallen on
    black, the probability is still the same. If it were possible to predict one color
    from others, then the wheel would not be a good randomizer. Remember that neither
    a roulette wheel nor the ball has a memory.</p>

  <p>
    Every gambling "system" is based on this fallacy, or its Sibling. Any gambler who
    thinks that he can record the results of a roulette wheel, or the throws at a craps
    table, or lotto numbers, and use this information to predict future outcomes is
    probably committing some form of the gambler's fallacy.</p>

  <h3>
    Q&A:</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Q:</strong> Isn't there a sort-of fallacy embedded in the form of the gambler's
    fallacy, which is that it depends on the gambling device being "fair", something
    which (I submit) is technically unknowable and at best inferred through a series
    of trials? Put another way, while it is a fallacy to expect something other than
    a chance outcome for the next trial on a fair gambling device, I don't think it's
    a fallacy to expect a different-from-chance outcome on an unfair device. What if
    the actual reasoning that occurs "in the wild" and at Vegas is something like this?</p>
  <p>
    <strong>P:</strong> A series of events has occurred which would be highly-improbable
    if the device is fair.
    <br />
    <strong>C:</strong> The device is (probably) not fair.</p>
  <p>
    &#8213;David A. Ventimiglia</p>
  <p>
    <strong>A:</strong> You're right that we test randomizers for fairness primarily
    through trials, but that's not the only consideration. A die will be a good randomizer
    if it's a cube and evenly weighted, which can be tested by direct measurement. However,
    it isn't necessary that it be perfect. No physical randomizer will ever be perfectly
    fair; for instance, no die will ever be perfectly symmetrical or absolutely evenly
    weighted. As with other mathematical laws&#8213;as well as scientific laws in general,
    and even the laws of logic&#8213;the laws of probability apply to the physical world
    only approximately. But if a randomizer approximates fairness closely enough, then
    the gambler's fallacy is, indeed, <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious" title="Committing a logical fallacy.">
      fallacious</a>. So, to be perfectly precise, the form of the fallacy should be
    expressed in the following way:</p>
  <p>
    An approximately fair gambling device has produced a "run".
    <br />
    Therefore, on the next trial of the device, it is significantly less likely than
    chance to continue the run.</p>
  <p>
    There was a famous "man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo" who studied the roulette
    wheels in the casino and discovered that one seemed to favor certain numbers. By
    betting those numbers, the man was able to amass a small fortune. When the casino
    realized what he was doing, it switched the roulette wheels around at night while
    the casino was closed, and the man began to lose heavily. Nowadays, you can bet
    that casinos around the world have learned the lesson, which is why there has been
    no "man who broke the bank" since the 19th century.</p>
  <p>
    However, consider how the man who broke the bank reasoned: Certain numbers on the
    wheel had come up more often than expected. Therefore, the man bet on those numbers!
    According to the Gambler's Fallacy, he should have bet <em>against</em> them because
    it was the other numbers on the wheel that were overdue. Rather than the Gambler's
    Fallacy, his reasoning actually took the form of its sibling, the Hot Hand Fallacy;
    that is, he bet that the run would continue.</p>
  <p>
    In cases such as the Monte Carlo one, it may be reasonable to conclude that a gambling
    device is not fair based upon a highly improbable series of results. In those rare
    cases, the Hot Hand form of <a href="glossary.html#Argument" title="A unit of reasoning.">
      argument</a> is not fallacious. The Gambler's Fallacy, in contrast, always is.</p>
