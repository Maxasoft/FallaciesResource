  <h3>
    Etymology:</h3>
  <img src="http://fallacyfiles.org/RedHerr1.bmp" alt="red herring" align="right">
  <p>
    The name of this fallacy comes from the sport of fox hunting in which a dried, smoked
    herring, which is red in color, is dragged across the trail of the fox to throw
    the hounds off the scent. Thus, a "red herring" <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>
    is one which distracts the audience from the issue in question through the introduction
    of some irrelevancy. This frequently occurs during debates when there is an at least
    implicit topic, yet it is easy to lose track of it. By extension, it applies to
    any argument in which the <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a>es are logically
    irrelevant to the <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">conclusion</a>.
    <h3>
      Exposition:</h3>
    <p>
      This is the most general fallacy of irrelevance. Any argument in which the premisses
      are logically unrelated to the conclusion commits this fallacy.
      <h3>
        History:</h3>
      <p>
        This fallacy is often known by the Latin name "ignoratio elenchi", or "ignorance
        of refutation". The ignorance involved is either ignorance of the conclusion to
        be refuted&#151even deliberately <em>ignoring</em> it&#151or ignorance of what constitutes
        a refutation, so that the attempt misses the mark. This explanation goes back to
        Aristotle's <cite>On Sophistical Refutations</cite>, the focus of which is <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">
          fallacious</a> refutations in debate. As with all of Aristotle's original fallacies,
        its application has widened to all arguments.
        <p>
          Of course, <a href="ambiguit.html">fallacies of ambiguity</a> involve irrelevance,
          in that the premisses are logically irrelevant to the conclusion, but this fact
          is disguised by <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguous">ambiguous</a> language. However,
          Aristotle classifies Ignoratio Elenchi as language-independent, though he does say:
          <blockquote>
            One might, with some violence, bring this fallacy into the group of fallacies dependent
            on language as well.</blockquote>
          <p>
            But this would make Ignoratio Elenchi so wide that just about every fallacy&#151with
            the exception of Begging the Question&#151would be a <a href="glossary.html#Subfallacy">
              subfallacy</a> of it. This is too wide to be useful, so I will follow Aristotle
            in restricting it to non-linguistic fallacies, excluding those disguised by ambiguity
            or <a href="glossary.html#Vagueness">vagueness</a>.
            <h3>
              Exposure:</h3>
            <p>
              Logical relevance is itself a vague and ambiguous notion. It is ambiguous in that
              different types of reasoning involve distinct types of relevance. It is vague in
              that there is little agreement among logicians about even <a href="glossary.html#Deductive">
                deductive</a> relevance, with logicians divided into different camps, so-called
              "relevance" logicians arguing for a more restrictive notion of logical relevance
              than so-called "classical" logicians.
              <p>
                Another ambiguity of the term "relevance" is that <em>logical</em> relevance can
                be confused with <em>psycho</em>logical relevance. The fact that two ideas are logically
                related may be one reason why one makes you think of the other, but there are other
                reasons, and the stream of consciousness often includes associations between ideas
                that are not at all logically related. Moreover, not all logical relations are obvious,
                so that a logical relationship may not cause a psychological relationship at all.
                <p>
                  Because it is the most general fallacy of irrelevance, most fallacious arguments
                  will be identified as some more specific type of irrelevancy.
