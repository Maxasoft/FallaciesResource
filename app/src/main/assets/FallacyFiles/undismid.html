      The 29 students in Mr Strang's classroom gravely considered the two sentences scrawled
      across the freshly washed blackboard:
      <p>
        All A's are C's.
        <br />
        All B's are C's.
        <p>
          "The apparent conclusion&#151that all A's are B's&#151does have a certain allure,
          a kind of appealing logic."
          <p>
            Mr Strang blinked myopically, his wrinkled face resembling that of a good-natured
            troll. Then he whirled, and his chalk drew a large screeching X through both sentences.

      "Of course," he snapped, "it's also dead wrong. Its error can easily be verified
      by substituting 'teenager' for A, 'ostrich' for B, and 'two-legged' for C in the
      original premises. Thus, all teenagers are two-legged, all ostriches are two-legged,
      and therefore all teenagers are ostriches. I doubt you'd accept that conclusion."</blockquote>

            Undistributed Middle is one of the most famous fallacies, and is sometimes used
            as a synonym for "fallacious argument", that is, some people know that an undistributed
            middle is somehow logically bad, and mistakenly think that any bad <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
              argument</a> must have one. In other words, they seem to reason as follows:
            <p>
              All arguments with undistributed middle terms are bad arguments.
              <br />
              This is a bad argument.
              <br />
              Therefore, this argument has an undistributed middle.

              <p>
                This argument <em>is</em> a bad argument because it has an undistributed middle
                term, namely, "bad arguments"!

                    [A] major component of reasoning takes place in a frontal module of the brain, a
                    module being a specialized, relatively independent group of inter-connected nerve
                    cells performing a particular category of tasks. Patients who have an injury confined
                    to this module&#133have a&#133specific syndrome in which reason is disturbed without
                    a generalized disorder of cognition. Appropriately enough, this isolated impairment
                    of the module for reason is called "the dysexecutive syndrome," a condition analogous
                    to selective disorders of language (the aphasias) or memory (the amnesias).

                    <p>
                    Patients with the dysexecutive syndrome&#133make mistakes in assembling rational
                    sequences of thought. For example, one patient with the dysexecutive syndrome concluded
                    that there are money-trees because "money is green [in the United States] and so
                    are trees, so money must grow on trees."</blockquote>
