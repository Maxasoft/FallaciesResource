          The prison in question is at the General Security Services headquarters, which was
          inspected by my team in Jan. 1998. It appeared to be a prison for children&#151toddlers
          up to pre-adolescents&#151whose only crime was to be the offspring of those who
          have spoken out politically against the regime of Saddam Hussein. It was a horrific
          scene. Actually I'm not going to describe what I saw there because what I saw was
          so horrible that it can be used by those who would want to promote war with Iraq,
          and right now I'm waging peace.</blockquote>

            Exposition:</h3>
          <p>
            A one-sided case presents only evidence favoring its <a href="glossary.html#Conclusion">
              conclusion</a>, and ignores or downplays the evidence against it. In <a href="glossary.html#Inductive">
                inductive</a> reasoning, it is important to consider <em>all</em> of the available
            evidence before coming to a conclusion. For example, suppose that you have observed
            several white swans; then you might conclude:
            <p>
              All swans are white.
              <p>
                However, if you have observed even one black swan, you should not come to this conclusion.
                Instead, you might draw one of the weaker conclusions:
                <img src="EscherSwans.jpg" border="0" alt="Escher swans detail">
                <ul>
                  <li>Almost all swans are white.
                    <li>Most swans are white.
                      <li>
                  Typically, swans are white.</ul>
                <p>
                  So, the total evidence available to you consists in observations of several white
                  swans and a black one. Whatever conclusion that you draw needs to be consistent
                  with this evidence, but "all swans are white" is inconsistent with there being even
                  one black swan. To leave the black swan out of your reasoning would be One-sidedness.
                  <h3>
                    Exposure:</h3>
                  <p>
                    It is by no means always <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a> to present
                    a one-sided <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>. As is usual with fallacies,
                    we have to take the context of the argument into consideration. For instance, a
                    trial attorney presents a one-sided case in favor of a client. It is not a defense
                    attorney's job to present the evidence for the defendant's guilt, rather that is
                    the job of the prosecutor. Likewise, the prosecutor's job is to present a one-sided
                    case for conviction. Both sides are presented in a trial, just not by the same persons.
                    This is the way that adversarial systems, such as the legal system, work: each side
                    presents a biased case, and the jury comes to a decision based upon hearing both
                    sides. In this way, even though each side is slanted, all of the relevant evidence
                    is presented by whichever side it happens to favor.
                    <p>
                      Other contexts of argumentation are similarly adversarial, for example, partisan
                      politics such as election campaigns. A candidate's campaign will present only a
                      positive case for the candidate's election, and a case against the candidate's opponents.
                      However, the other side can always be relied upon to present the negative case.
                      We voters, by listening to both sides of the campaign, can make an objective decision
                      about how to vote based upon all the available evidence. This is why it is important
                      to pay attention to all sides during a campaign, and to hear different political
                      points of view. People who listen to only one side will inevitably form one-sided
                      opinions.
                      <p>
                        Another major source of non-fallacious bias is in the world of advertising. We have
                        no reason to expect advertisers or salespeople to tell us what is wrong with their
                        product, or why we should buy some other manufacturer's product instead. This is
                        why we should take such pitches with a heavy dose of skepticism. Unfortunately,
                        all too seldom do we hear the other side of the argument, as promoters of products
                        seem to be reluctant to criticize competitors. As rational consumers, we need to
                        turn to consumer publications to hear the other side of the story.
                        <p>
                          One-sidedness is fallacious in contexts where we have a right to demand objectivity.
                          Two such contexts are news stories and scientific or other scholarly writing:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Most major American newspapers aspire to a reputation for objectivity, or fairness,
                              on their news pages. For instance, they restrict partisan political commentary to
                              the editorial and op-ed ("opposite the editorial") pages. News stories, of course,
                              are not usually arguments, so it would be&#151strictly speaking&#151incorrect to
                              accuse a biased story of committing the <em>fallacy</em> of One-sidedness. Since
                              it isn't an argument at all, it isn't a <em>fallacious</em> argument. But slanting
                              in a news story may lead the reader into drawing false conclusions, which means
                              that the story is a <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap">boobytrap</a>, and the reader's
                              reasoning is fallacious, albeit inadvertently.
                              <li>Scholars are expected to examine <em>all</em> of the evidence and come to a conclusion.
                                Thus, a one-sided lack of objectivity is a cardinal scholarly sin. This is why scholars
                                should listen to others in their field even when&#151in fact, <em>especially</em>
                            when&#151they disagree. It is only when scholars have heard and weighed all of the
                            evidence, and considered all of the arguments, that they can come to an objective
                            conclusion.</ul>

                            <blockquote>
                              It seems to me there are many kinds of one-sidedness that are strategies more than
                              arguments. For example, what I call "controlling the microphone." If somehow one
                              side can control when a microphone is turned on (literally or figuratively), then
                              the opposition may not be heard. If one side controls access to mass media, to certain
                              publications, etc., then only their side is presented or their opponents' arguments
                              are filtered to their advantage. Congress has variants of this, for example, "filling
                              up the amendment tree" which prevents opposing amendments from being added. Or simply
                              limiting debate before all the issues have been aired. The judicial branch may deny
                              someone a hearing which lets the status quo stand without further argument. Large
                              advertisers try to fill the airwaves with their pitch, leaving little space for
                              the opposition. I'm tempted to call these something like meta-fallacies or hyper-fallacies
                              because they aren't arguments per se but strategies for promoting something.&#8213;Ralph
                              Gillmann</blockquote>
                            <p>
                              I would resist the temptation if I were you. A "meta-fallacy" would be a fallacy
                              about a fallacy, and a "hyper-fallacy" would be a fallacy on steroids, neither of
                              which seems right. The examples that you give are all good examples of what I call
                              "boobytraps", that is, nonarguments that can cause someone to fall into fallacious
                              reasoning. Much of what is called "slanting", or&#8213;in the context of propaganda&#8213;"card
                              stacking", is the setting up of one-sided boobytraps.
                              <p>
                                Slanting can be one of the most insidiously deceptive boobytraps, because simply
                                leaving out relevant information can lead people seriously astray. In order to do
                                this, dictatorships and totalitarian governments have always attempted to monopolize
                                the news media and education, in order to control what information people receive.
                                It's almost impossible to detect such one-sidedness if you lack other sources for
                                the relevant facts, which is what makes a free press so important.
