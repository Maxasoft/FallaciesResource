  <h3>
    Exposition:</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="glossary.html#Vagueness">Vagueness</a> is a characteristic of language,
    specifically of those <a href="glossary.html#Term">term</a>s which classify or qualify
    objects, that is, common nouns and adjectives. Such terms divide the world of objects
    into those the term applies to&#151the extension of the term&#151and those to which
    it doesn't. For example, the common noun "elephant" divides the world into elephants
    and non-elephants.
    <p>
      What characterizes a vague term is the existence of borderline cases which do not
      clearly belong or not belong to its extension. For example, consider the familiar
      concept of "chair": some things are clearly chairs&#151what you're sitting on right
      now, for instance&#151and others are clearly not&#151for instance, an elephant even
      though you might sit upon one. But there are many borderline cases: barstools, beanbag
      "chairs", school desks, etc.
      <p>
        Vagueness is to be distinguished from <a href="glossary.html#Ambiguity">ambiguity</a>,
        though rather fittingly the distinction is vague! An ambiguous term is one with
        more than one meaning, whereas vagueness is characteristic of a single meaning that
        has borderline cases. However, it is not unusual for a term to be both ambiguous
        and vague; in fact, this is the usual case.
        <p>
          Vagueness is a pervasive characteristic of language, and there is no reason to think
          that it can or should be eliminated. This is because many things in the world that
          we wish to distinguish lie upon qualitative scales. The color spectrum is a good
          example of this, and we definitely wish to distinguish colors such as orange and
          yellow, even though the difference between them is one of wavelength.
          <p>
            Moreover, the fallacy of Vagueness occurs only when the appearance of <a href="glossary.html#Sound">
              sound</a>ness in an <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a> depends upon
            vagueness in its terms. The mere fact of vagueness is not sufficient to justify
            an accusation of fallacy, but it is sometimes a <a href="glossary.html#Boobytrap">
              boobytrap</a> which can cause the unsuspecting person to fall into fallacious
            reasoning. For this reason, it is useful to be aware of and on our guard against
            vague terms, so that we can continue to use our vague language without being ensnared
            by it.
