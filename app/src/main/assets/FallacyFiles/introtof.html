    What is a logical fallacy?</h1>

  <p>
    A "fallacy" is a mistake, and a "logical" fallacy is a mistake in reasoning. There
    are, of course, other types of mistake than mistakes in reasoning. For instance,
    factual mistakes are sometimes referred to as "fallacies". However, the Fallacy
    Files is specifically concerned, not with factual errors, but with logical ones.
    <p>
      In logic, the term "fallacy" is used in two related, but distinct ways. For example:
      <ol>
        <li>"Argumentum ad Hominem is a fallacy."
          <li>
        "Your argument is a fallacy."</ol>
      <p>
        In 1, what is called a "fallacy" is a <em>type</em> of <a href="glossary.html#Argument">
          argument</a>, so that a "fallacy" in this sense is a type of mistaken reasoning.
        In 2, it is a <em>specific</em> argument that is said to be a "fallacy", so that
        in this sense a "fallacy" is an argument which uses bad reasoning.
        <p>
          Clearly, these two senses are related: in 2, the argument may be called a "fallacy"
          because it is an instance of <a href="adhomine.html">Argumentum ad Hominem</a>,
          or some other <em>type</em> of fallacy. In order to keep these two senses distinct,
          I restrict the term "fallacy" to the first sense. For me, a fallacy is always a
          <em>kind</em> of argument.
          <p>
            For the second sense, I will say that a specific argument "commits" a fallacy, or
            is "<a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a>". So, in my terminology, 2
            above commits a <a href="glossary.html#CategoryMistake">category mistake</a>, for
            there is no way that your specific argument could be a fallacy. I would say, instead:
            <p>
              3. "Your argument commits a fallacy. It's fallacious."
              <p>
                However, not just any type of mistake in reasoning counts as a logical fallacy.
                To be a fallacy, a type of reasoning must be potentially deceptive, it must be likely
                to fool at least <em>some</em> of the people <em>some</em> of the time. Moreover,
                in order for a fallacy to be worth identifying and naming, it must be a <em>common</em>
                type of logical error.

                  History</h2>
                <p>
                  Aristotle was both the first formal logician&#151codifying the rules of correct
                  reasoning&#151and the first <em>in</em>formal logician&#151cataloging types of incorrect
                  reasoning, namely, fallacies. He was both the first to name types of logical error,
                  and the first to group them into categories. The result is his book <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/sophist_refut.html"
                    target="_blank"><cite>On Sophistical Refutations</cite></a>.
                  <p>
                    However, Aristotle's teacher, Plato, deserves credit for being the first philosopher
                    to collect examples of bad reasoning, which is an important preliminary piece of
                    field work before naming and cataloging. Plato's "<a href="http://www.eserver.org/philosophy/plato/euthydemus.txt"
                      target="_blank">Euthydemus</a>" preserves a collection of fallacious arguments
                    in dialogue form, putting the perhaps exaggerated examples into the mouths of two
                    <a href="glossary.html#Sophist">sophist</a>s. For this reason, fallacious arguments
                    are sometimes called "sophisms" and bad reasoning "sophistry". Aristotle refers
                    to a few of these examples as instances of his named fallacies.
                    <p>
                      In the centuries since Plato and Aristotle, many great philosophers and logicians
                      have contributed to fallacy studies, among them John Locke, John Stuart Mill, Jeremy
                      Bentham, and Arthur Schopenhauer.

                      <h2>
                        Why study fallacies?</h2>
                      <p>
                        Why study how to reason <em>in</em>correctly; why not just study how to reason <em>
                          correct</em>ly? There are two reasons:
                        <ol>
                          <li>Even if <em>you</em> could count on reasoning correctly 100% of the time, you
                            cannot count on others doing so. In logical self-defense, you need to be able to
                            spot poor reasoning, and&#151more importantly&#151to understand it. To be able to
                            correct others' mistakes, or to refute them convincingly, you need to understand
                            <em>why</em> they are wrong.
                            <li>Studying formal logic and the rules of <em>correct</em> reasoning is like having
                              a road map that shows how to get from point <strong>A</strong> to point <strong>B</strong>.
                          However, even the best navigators sometimes get lost, and it helps if the roads
                          that go nowhere are clearly labeled "DEAD END", "WRONG WAY", or "DO NOT ENTER".</ol>
                        <img src="http://fallacyfiles.org/DeadEnd1.gif" alt="Dead End" border="0">
                        <p>
                          That is what fallacy studies is all about: marking the wrong turns that reasoners
                          are likely to take. Thus, studying fallacies is no substitute for studying the positive
                          principles of good reasoning&#151learning to navigate through logical space, so
                          to speak. You would not set out on a trip without a road map, hoping to rely upon
                          the "DEAD END" signs to get to your destination. Similarly, the <cite>Fallacy Files</cite>
                          are no replacement for the study of formal and informal logic, only a supplement.
