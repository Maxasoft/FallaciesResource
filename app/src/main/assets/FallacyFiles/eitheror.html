    Example:</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Gerda Reith is convinced that superstition can be a positive force. "It gives you
    a sense of control by making you think you can work out what's going to happen next,"
    she says. "And it also makes you feel lucky. And to take a risk or to enter into
    a chancy situation, you really have to believe in your own luck. In that sense,
    it's a very useful way of thinking, because the alternative is fatalism, which is
    to say, 'Oh, there's nothing I can do.' At least superstition makes people do things."</blockquote>

        Exposition:</h3>
      <p>
        The problem with this fallacy is not formal, but is found in its <a href="glossary.html#Disjunctive">
          disjunctive</a>&#151"either-or"&#151premiss: an <a href="glossary.html#Argument">argument</a>
        of this type is <a href="glossary.html#Fallacious">fallacious</a> when its disjunctive
        <a href="glossary.html#Premiss">premiss</a> is fallaciously supported.
        <h3>
          Exposure:</h3>
        <p>
          The Black-or-White Fallacy, like <a href="begquest.html">Begging the Question</a>,
          is a <a href="glossary.html#Validating">validating</a> form of argument. For example,
          some instances have the validating form:
          <p>
            <strong>Simple Constructive Dilemma:</strong>
            <p>
              Either <strong>p</strong> or <strong>q</strong>.
              <br />
              If <strong>p</strong> then <strong>r</strong>.
              <br />
              If <strong>q</strong> then <strong>r</strong>.
              <br />
              Therefore, <strong>r</strong>.
              <p>
                For this reason, this fallacy is sometimes called "false" or "bogus" dilemma. However,
                these names are misleading, since not all instances have the form of a dilemma;
                some instead take the following, also validating form:
                <p>
                  <strong>Disjunctive Syllogism:</strong>
                  <p>
                    Either <strong>p</strong> or <strong>q</strong>.
                    <br />
                    Not-<strong>p</strong>.
                    <br />
                    Therefore, <strong>q</strong>.
                    <p>
                      Usually, the <a href="glossary.html#TruthValue">truth-value</a> of premisses is
                      not a question for logic, but for other sciences, or common sense. So, while an
                      argument with a false premiss is un<a href="glossary.html#Sound">sound</a>, it is
                      usually not considered fallacious. However, when a disjunctive premiss is false
                      for specifically logical reasons, or when the support for it is based upon a fallacy,
                      then the argument commits the Black-or-White Fallacy.
                      <p>
                        One such logical error is confusing <a href="glossary.html#ContraryProps">contrary</a>
                        with <a href="glossary.html#ContradictoryProps">contradictory propositions</a>:
                        of two contradictory propositions, exactly one will be true; but of two contrary
                        propositions, <em>at most</em> one will be true, but both may be false. For example:
                        <table cellspacing="25" align="center">
                          <tr>
                            <th colspan="2">
                              Contradictories
                            </th>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td>
                              It's hot today.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                              It's not hot today.
                            </td>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <th colspan="2">

                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td>
                              It's hot today.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                              It's cold today.
                            </td>
                          </tr>
                        </table>
                        <p>
                          A <a href="glossary.html#Disjunction">disjunction</a> whose <a href="glossary.html#Disjunct">
                            disjunct</a>s are contradictories is an instance of the <a href="glossary.html#LawOfExcludedMid">
                              Law of Excluded Middle</a>, so it is <a href="glossary.html#LogicallyTrue">logically
                                true</a>. For instance, "either it's hot today or it's not hot today." In
                          contrast, a disjunction whose disjuncts are contraries is logically <a href="glossary.html#ContingentProp">
                            contingent</a>. For example, "either it's hot today or it's cold today." If an
                          arguer confuses the latter with the former in the premiss of an argument, they commit
                          the Black-or-White Fallacy.

                              Fatalism is not <em>the</em> alternative to superstition; it is <em>an</em> alternative.
                              Superstition involves acting in ways that are ineffective, whereas fatalism involves
                              failing to act even in situations in which our efforts can be effective. Fortunately,
                              there are other alternatives, such as recognizing that there are some things we
                              can control and other things we cannot, and only acting in the first case.
