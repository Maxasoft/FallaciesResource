  <h3>Fallacy: Genetic Fallacy</h3>
  <hr />

  <h4><a name="description">Description of Genetic Fallacy</a></h4>

  <p>A Genetic Fallacy is a line of "reasoning" in which a
  perceived defect in the origin of a claim or thing is taken to be
  evidence that discredits the claim or thing itself. It is also a line of
  reasoning in which the origin of a claim or thing is taken to be
  evidence for the claim or thing. This sort of "reasoning" has
  the following form:

  <ol>
    <li>The origin of a claim or thing is presented.
  <li>The claim is true(or false) or  the thing is supported (or discredited).
  </ol>

  <p>It is clear that sort of "reasoning" is fallacious. For
  example: "Bill claims that 1+1=2. However, my parents brought me up
  to believe that 1+1=254, so Bill must be wrong."

  <p>It should be noted that there are some cases in which the origin of a
  claim is relevant to the truth or falsity of the claim. For example, a
  claim that comes from a reliable expert is likely to be true (provided
  it is in her area of expertise).

  <h4><a name="examples">Examples of Genetic Fallacy</a></h4>

  <ol>

  <p><li>"The current Chancellor of Germany was in the Hitler Youth
  at age 3. With that sort of background, his so called 'reform' plan must
  be a facist program."

  <p><li>"I was brought up to believe in God, and my parents told me
  God exists, so He must."

  <p><li>"Sure, the media claims that Senator Bedfellow was taking
  kickbacks. But we all know about the media's credibility, don't
  we."

  </ol>
