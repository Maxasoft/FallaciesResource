	<h3>Fallacy: Appeal to Emotion</h3>
	<hr />
	
	<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Emotion</a></h4>
	
	<p>An Appeal to Emotion is a fallacy with the following structure:
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Favorable emotions are associated with X.
	<li>Therefore, X is true.
	</ol>
	
	<p>This fallacy is committed when someone manipulates peoples' emotions
	in order to get them to accept a claim as being true.  More formally,
	this sort of "reasoning" involves the substitution of various
	means of producing strong emotions in place of evidence for a claim.  If
	the favorable emotions associated with X influence the person to accept
	X as true because they "feel good about X," then he has fallen
	prey to the fallacy.
	
	<p>This sort of "reasoning" is very common in politics and it
	serves as the basis for a large portion of modern advertising. Most
	political speeches are aimed at generating feelings in people so that
	these feelings will get them to vote or act a certain way. in the case
	of advertising, the commercials are aimed at evoking emotions that will
	influence people to buy certain products. In most cases, such speeches
	and commercials are notoriously free of real evidence.
	
	<p>This sort of "reasoning" is quite evidently fallacious. It
	is fallacious because using various tactics to incite emotions in people
	does not serve as evidence for a claim. For example, if a person were
	able to inspire in a person an incredible hatred of the claim that 1+1 =
	2 and then inspired the person to love the claim that 1+1 = 3, it would
	hardly follow that  the claim that 1+1 = 3 would be adequately
	supported.
	
	<p>It should be noted that in many cases it is not particularly obvious
	that the person committing the fallacy is attempting to support a claim.
	In many cases, the user of the fallacy will appear to be attempting to
	move people to take an action, such as buying a product or fighting in a
	war.  However, it is possible to determine what sort of claim the person
	is actually attempting to support. In such cases one needs to ask
	"what sort of claim is this person attempting to get people to
	accept and act on?" Determining this claim (or claims) might take
	some work. However, in many cases it will be quite evident. For example,
	if a political leader is attempting to convince her followers to
	participate in certain acts of violence by the use of a hate speech,
	then her claim would be "you should participate in these acts of
	violence."  In this case, the "evidence" would be the
	hatred evoked in the followers. This hatred would serve to make them
	favorable inclined towards the claim that they should engage in the acts
	of violence.  As another example, a beer commercial might show happy,
	scantily clad men and women prancing about a beach, guzzling beer. In
	this case the claim would be "you should buy this beer." The
	"evidence" would be the excitement evoked by seeing the
	beautiful people guzzling the beer.
	
	<p>This fallacy is actually an extremely effective persuasive device. As
	many people have argued, peoples' emotions often carry much more force
	than their reason.  Logical argumentation is often difficult and time
	consuming and it rarely has the power to spurn people to action.  It is
	the power of this fallacy that explains its great popularity and wide
	usage. However, it is still a fallacy.
	
	<p>In all fairness it must be noted that the use of tactics to inspire
	emotions is an important skill. Without an appeal to peoples' emotions,
	it is often difficult to get them to take action or to perform at their
	best. For example, no good coach presents her team with syllogisms
	before the big game. Instead she inspires them with emotional terms and
	attempts to "fire" them up. There is nothing inherently wrong
	with this. However, it is not any acceptable form of argumentation. As
	long as one is able to clearly distinguish between what inspires
	emotions and what justifies a claim, one is unlikely to fall prey to
	this fallacy.
	
	<p>As a final point, in many cases it will be difficult to distinguish
	an Appeal to Emotion from some other fallacies and in many cases
	multiple fallacies may be committed. For example, many
	<a href="AdHominem.html">Ad Hominem</a>s
	will be very similar to Appeals to Emotion and, in some cases, both
	fallacies will be committed. As an example, a leader might attempt to
	invoke hatred of a person to inspire his followers to accept that they
	should reject her claims. The same attack could function as an Appeal to
	Emotion and a
	<a href="PersonalAttack.html">Personal Attack</a>.
	In the first case, the attack would be aimed at making the followers
	feel very favorable about rejecting her claims. In the second case, the
	attack would be aimed at making the followers reject the person's claims
	because of some perceived (or imagined) defect in her character.
	
	<p>This fallacy is related to the
	<a href="AppealToPopularity.html">Appeal to Popularity</a>
	fallacy.  Despite the differences between these two fallacies, they are
	both united by the fact that they involve appeals to emotions. In both
	cases the fallacies aim at getting people to accept claims based on how
	they or others feel about the claims and not based on evidence for the
	claims.
	
	<p>Another way to look at these two fallacies is as follows
	
	<p><a href="AppealToPopularity.html">Appeal to Popularity</a>
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Most people approve of X.
	  <li>So, I should approve of X, too.
	  <li>Since I approve of X, X must be true.
	</ol>
	
	<p>Appeal to Emotion
	
	<ol>
	  <li>I approve of X.
  	<li>Therefore, X is true. 
	</ol>
	
	<p>On this view, in an
	<a href="AppealToPopularity.html">Appeal to Popularity</a>
	the claim is accepted because most people approve of the claim. In the
	case of an Appeal to Emotion the claim is accepted because the
	individual approves of the claim because of the emotion of approval he
	feels in regards to the claim.

	<p><li>Bill goes to hear a politician speak. The politician tells the crowd
	about the evils of the government and the need to throw out the people
	who are currently in office. After hearing the speech, Bill is full of
	hatred for the current politicians. Because of this, he feels good about
	getting rid of the old politicians and accepts that it is the right
	thing to do because of how he feels.
