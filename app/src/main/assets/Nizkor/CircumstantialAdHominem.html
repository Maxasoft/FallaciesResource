  <h3>Fallacy: Circumstantial Ad Hominem</h3>
  <hr />

  <h4><a name="description">Description of Circumstantial Ad Hominem</a></h4>

  <p>A Circumstantial ad Hominem is a fallacy in which one attempts to
  attack a claim by asserting that the person making the claim is making
  it simply out of self interest. In some cases, this fallacy involves
  substituting an attack on a person's circumstances (such as the person's
  religion, political affiliation, ethnic background, etc.). The fallacy
  has the following forms:

  <ol>
    <li>Person A makes claim X.</li>
    <li>Person B asserts that A makes claim X because it is in A's interest to claim X.</li>
    <li>Therefore claim X is false.</li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    <li>Person A makes claim X.</li>
    <li>Person B makes an attack on A's circumstances.</li>
    <li>Therefore X is false.
  </ol>

  <p>A Circumstantial ad Hominem is a fallacy because a person's interests
  and circumstances have no bearing on the truth or falsity of the claim
  being made. While a person's interests will provide them with motives to
  support certain claims, the claims stand or fall on their own. It is
  also the case that a person's circumstances (religion, political
  affiliation, etc.) do not affect the truth or falsity of the claim. This
  is made quite clear by the following example: "Bill claims that
  1+1=2. But he is a Republican, so his claim is false."

  <p>There are times when it is prudent to suspicious of a person's
  claims, such as when it is evident that the claims are being biased by
  the person's interests. For example, if a  tobacco company
  representative claims that tobacco does not cause cancer, it would be
  prudent to not simply accept the claim. This is because the person has a
  motivation to make the claim, whether it is true or not. However, the
  mere fact that the person has a motivation to make the claim does not
  make it false. For example, suppose a parent  tells her son that
  sticking a fork in a light socket would be dangerous. Simply because she
  has a motivation to say this obviously does not make her claim false.

  <h4><a name="examples">Examples of Circumstantial Ad Hominem</a></h4>

  <ol>

  <p><li>"She asserts that we need more military spending, but that
  is false, since she is only saying it because she is a Republican."

  <p><li>"I think that we should reject what Father Jones has to say
  about the ethical issues of abortion because he is a Catholic priest.
  After all, Father Jones is required to hold such views."

  <p><li>"Of course the Senator from Maine opposes a reduction in
  naval spending. After all, Bath Ironworks, which produces warships, is
  in Maine."

  <p><li>"Bill claims that tax breaks for corporations increases
  development. Of course, Bill is the CEO of a corporation."
