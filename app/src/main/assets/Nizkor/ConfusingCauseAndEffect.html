  <h3>Fallacy: Confusing Cause and Effect</h3>
  <hr />

  <p>Also Known as:
  <a href="QuestionableCause.html">Questionable Cause</a>

  <h4><a name="description">Description of Confusing Cause and Effect</a></h4>

  <p>Confusing Cause and Effect is a fallacy that has the following
  general form:

  <ol>
    <li>A and B regularly occur together.
  <li>Therefore A is the cause of B.
  </ol>

  <p>This fallacy requires that there is not, in fact, a common cause that
  actually causes both A and B.

  <p>This fallacy is committed when a person assumes that one event must
  cause another just because the events occur together. More formally,
  this fallacy involves drawing the conclusion that A is the cause of B
  simply because A and B are in regular conjunction (and there is not a
  common cause that is actually the cause of A and B). The mistake being
  made is that the causal conclusion is being drawn without adequate
  justification.

  <p>In some cases it will be evident that the fallacy is being committed.
  For example, a person might claim that an illness was caused by a person
  getting a fever. In this case, it would be quite clear that the fever
  was caused by illness and not the other way around. In other cases, the
  fallacy is not always evident.  One factor that makes causal reasoning
  quite difficult is that it is not always evident what is the cause and
  what is the effect. For example, a problem child might be the cause of
  the parents being short tempered or the short temper of the parents
  might be the cause of the child being problematic. The difficulty is
  increased by the fact that some situations might involve feedback. For
  example, the parents' temper might cause the child to become problematic
  and the child's behavior could worsen the parents' temper. In such cases
  it could be rather difficult to sort out what caused what in the first
  place.

  <p>In order to determine that the fallacy has been committed, it must be
  shown that the causal conclusion has not been adequately supported and
  that the person committing the fallacy has confused the actual cause
  with the effect. Showing that the fallacy has been committed will
  typically involve determining the actual cause and the actual effect. In
  some cases, as noted above, this can be quite easy. In other cases it
  will be difficult. In some cases, it might be almost impossible. Another
  thing that makes causal reasoning difficult is that people often have
  very different conceptions of cause and, in some cases, the issues are
  clouded by emotions and ideologies. For example, people often claim
  violence on TV and in movies must be censored because it causes people
  to like violence. Other people claim that there is violence on TV and in
  movies because people like violence.  In this case, it is not obvious
  what the cause really is and the issue is clouded by the fact that
  emotions often run high on this issue.

  <p>While causal reasoning can be difficult, many errors can be avoided
  with due care and careful testing procedures. This is due to the fact
  that the fallacy arises because the conclusion is drawn without due
  care. One way to avoid the fallacy is to pay careful attention to the
  temporal sequence of events. Since (outside of Star Trek), effects do
  not generally precede their causes, if A occurs after B, then A cannot
  be the cause of B. However, these methods go beyond the scope of this
  program.

  <p>All causal fallacies involve an error in causal reasoning. However,
  this fallacy differs from the other causal fallacies in terms of the
  error in reasoning being made. In the case of a
  <a href="PostHoc.html">Post Hoc</a>
  fallacy, the error is that a person is accepting that A is the cause of
  B simply because A occurs before B. In the case of the Fallacy of
  <a href="IgnoringACommonCause.html">Ignoring a Common Cause</a>
  A is taken to be the cause of B when there is, in fact, a third factor
  that is the cause of both A and B. For more information, see the
  relevant entries in this program.

  <h4><a name="examples">Examples of Confusing Cause and Effect</a></h4>

  <ol>

  <p><li>Bill and Joe are having a debate about music and moral decay:
  <br />Bill: "It seems clear to me that this new music is causing the youth to become corrupt."
  <br />Joe: "What do you mean?"
  <br />Bill: "This rap stuff is always telling the kids to kill cops, do drugs, and abuse women. That is all bad and the kids today shouldn't be doing that sort of stuff. We ought to ban that music!"
  <br />Joe: "So, you think that getting rid of the rap music would solve the drug, violence and sexism problems in the US?"
  <br />Bill: "Well, it wouldn't get rid of it all, but it would take care of a lot of it."
  <br />Joe: "Don't you think that most of the rap singers sing about that sort of stuff because that is what is really going on these days? I mean, people often sing about the conditions of their time, just like the people did in the sixties. But then I suppose that you think that people were against the war and into drugs just because they listened to Dylan and Baez."
  <br />Bill: "Well..."
  <br />Joe: "Well, it seems to me that the main cause of the content of the rap music is the pre-existing social conditions. If there weren't all these problems, the rap singers probably wouldn't be singing about them. I also think that if the social conditions were great, kids could listen to the music all day and not be affected."
  <br />Bill: "Well, I still think the rap music causes the problems. You can't argue against the fact that social ills really picked up at the same time rap music got started."

  <p><li>It is claimed by some people that severe illness is caused by
  depression and anger. After all, people who are severely ill are very
  often depressed and angry. Thus, it follows that the cause of severe
  illness actually is the depression and anger. So, a good and cheerful
  attitude is key to staying healthy.

  <p><li>Bill sets out several plates with bread on them. After a couple
  days, he notices that the bread has mold growing all over it. Bill
  concludes that the mold was produced by the bread going bad. When Bill
  tells his mother about his experiment, she tells him that the mold was
  the cause of the bread going bad and that he better clean up the mess if
  he wants to get his allowance this week.
