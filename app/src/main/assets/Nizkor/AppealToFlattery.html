	<h3>Fallacy: Appeal to Flattery</h3>
	<hr />
	
	<p>Also Known as: Apple Polishing, various "colorful" expressions.
	
	<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Flattery</a></h4>
	
	<p>An Appeal to Flattery is a fallacy of the following form:
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Person A is flattered by person B.
	<li>Person B makes claim X.
	<li>Therefore X is true.
	</ol>
	
	<p>The basic idea behind this fallacy is that flattery is presented in
	the place of evidence for accepting a claim. this sort of
	"reasoning" is fallacious because flattery is not, in fact,
	evidence for a claim. This is especially clear in a case like this:
	"My Bill, that is a really nice tie. By the way, it is quite clear
	that one plus one is equal to forty three."

	<p><li>"Might I say that this is the best philosophy class I've ever

	<p><li>"That was a wonderful joke about AIDS boss, and I agree with you
	that the damn liberals are wrecking the country. Now about my
	raise..."
	
	<p><li>"That was a singularly brilliant idea. I have never seen such a
	clear and eloquent defense of Plato's position. If you do not mind, I'll
	base my paper on it. Provided that you allow me a little extra time past
	the deadline to work on it."
