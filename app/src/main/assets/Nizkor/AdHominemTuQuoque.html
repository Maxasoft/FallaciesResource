	<h3>Fallacy: Ad Hominem Tu Quoque</h3>
	
	<hr />
	    
	<p>Also Known as: "You Too Fallacy"
	
	<h4><a name="description">Description of Ad Hominem Tu Quoque</a></h4>
	
	<p>This fallacy is committed when it is concluded that a person's claim
	is false because 1) it is inconsistent with something else a person has
	said or 2) what a person says is inconsistent with her actions. This
	type of "argument" has the following form:
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Person A makes claim X.
	<li>Person B asserts that A's actions or past claims are inconsistent with the truth of claim X.
	<li>Therefore X is false.
	</ol>
	
	<p>The fact that a person makes inconsistent claims does not make any
	particular claim he makes false (although of any pair of inconsistent
	claims only one can be true - but both can be false). Also, the fact
	that a person's claims are not consistent with his actions might
	indicate that the person is a hypocrite but this does not prove his
	claims are false.

	<ol>
	
	<p><li>Bill: "Smoking is very unhealthy and leads to all sorts of problems. So take my advice and never start."
	<br />Jill: "Well, I certainly don't want to get cancer."
	<br />Bill: "I'm going to get a smoke. Want to join me Dave?"
	<br />Jill: "Well, I guess smoking can't be that bad. After all, Bill smokes."
	
	<p><li>Jill: "I think the gun control bill shouldn't be supported because it won't be effective and will waste money."
	<br />Bill: "Well, just last month you supported the bill. So I guess you're wrong now."
	
	<p><li>Peter: "Based on the arguments I have presented, it is evident that it is morally wrong to use animals for food or clothing."
	<br />Bill: "But you are wearing a leather jacket and you have a roast beef sandwich in your hand! How can you say that using animals for food and clothing is wrong!"
