	<h3>Fallacy: Appeal to Pity</h3>
	<hr />
	
	<p>Also known as: Ad Misericordiam
	
	<h4><a name="description">Description of Appeal to Pity</a></h4>
	
	<p>An Appeal to Pity is a fallacy in which a person substitutes a claim
	intended to create pity for evidence in an argument. The form of the
	"argument" is as follows:
	
	<ol>
	  <li>P is presented, with the intent to create pity.
	<li>Therefore claim C is true.
	</ol>
	
	<p>This line of "reasoning" is fallacious because pity does
	not serve as evidence for a claim. This is extremely clear in the
	following case: "You must accept that 1+1=46, after all I'm
	dying..." While you may pity me because I am dying, it would hardly
	make my claim true.
	
	<p>This fallacy differs from the
	<a href="AppealToConsequences.html">Appeal to the Consequences of a Belief</a>
	(ACB).  In the ACB fallacy, a person is using the effects of a belief as
	a substitute for evidence. In the Appeal to Pity, it is the feelings of
	pity or sympathy that are substituted for evidence.
	
	<p>It must be noted that there are cases in which claims that actually
	serve as evidence also evoke a feeling of pity. In such cases, the
	feeling of pity is still not evidence. The following is an example of a
	case in which a claim evokes pity and also serves as legitimate
	evidence:
	
	<p>Professor: "You missed the midterm, Bill."
	<br />Bill: "I know. I think you should let me take the makeup."
	<br />Professor: "Why?"
	<br />Bill: "I was hit by a truck on the way to the midterm. Since I had to go to the emergency room with a broken leg, I think I am entitled to a makeup."
	<br />Professor: "I'm sorry about the leg, Bill. Of course you can make it up."
	
	<p>The above example does not involve a fallacy. While the professor
	does feel sorry for Bill, she is justified in accepting Bill's claim
	that he deserves a makeup. After all getting run over by a truck would
	be a legitimate excuse for missing a test.

	<p><li>Jill: "He'd be a terrible coach for the team." <br />Bill:
	"He had his heart set on the job, and it would break if he didn't
	get it." <br />Jill: "I guess he'll do an adequate job."
	
	<p><li>"I'm positive that my work will meet your requirements. I really
	need the job since my grandmother is sick"
	
	<p><li>"I should receive an 'A' in this class. After all, if I don't
	get an 'A' I won't get the fellowship that I want."
