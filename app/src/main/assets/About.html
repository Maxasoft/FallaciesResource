	<h3>Purpose of Fallacies Resource</h3>
	<p>
	  I have been a software engineer most of my adult life and I have always been fascinated
	  by logic and how little people know about it and how to apply it. Nobody likes to think
   of themselves as illogical, and yet, the truth is that most people fall prey to biases, 
   cognitive dissonance, unsound logic, and bad critical thinking when formulating their 
   beliefs concerning big areas of discourse. Although, there is tons of material on the 
   psychology, sociology and the science of why people make bad decisions, this resource is to help as a reference for 
   fallacies (errors in logic).</p>
    
  <p>I wanted something that was easy to navigate, but, above all, I wanted it to be 
  	available offline to save time and bandwidth.</p>
  
  <p>Also, I have included links the actual pages used to extract the material found in this app. Although, it could be 
  considered plagiarism, it is actually out of the most sincere humbleness, respect and gratitude that I have done this. 
  These websites helped me hone in my critical thinking skills and I honestly hope that it will do so for the readers 
  since I believe that only through unobstructed communication unhindered by illogical ideas, can humans make this 
  planet a place where we can all live in peace and harmony.</p>
  
  <p>Enjoy!</p>
